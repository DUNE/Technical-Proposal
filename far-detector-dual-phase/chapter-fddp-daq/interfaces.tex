\section{Interfaces (David Cussans \& Matt Graham)}
\label{sec:fd-daq-intfc}

\metainfo{5 Pages.  This is a shared SP/DP section.  If there are assymetries simply describe both detector modules.}

\fixme{Include an image of each interface in appropriate section.  Can maybe refer to Figure~\ref{fig:daq-overview} but it currently lacks some of the interfaces.}
