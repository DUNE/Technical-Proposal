\subsection{Timing \& Synchronization}
\label{sec:fd-daq-timing}

\metainfo{David Cussans \& Kostas Manolopoulos.  This is a DP-specific section. The file is \texttt{far-detector-dual-phase/chapter-fddp-daq/design-timing.tex}}

The timing distribution is integrated into the TPC electronics design
and is described in section \ref{sec:fddp-tpc-elec-intfc-daq} and
\ref{sec:fddp-tpc-elec-wr} using a \dfirst{wr} network over
synchronous \SI{1}{\Gbps} Ethernet (SyncE), using PTPV2 packets.

The synchronization between the far detector and the beam pulses from
the LBNF beamline is done by a single overall system for single phase
and dual phase and is described in the folowing section.
