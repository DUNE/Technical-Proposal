\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-tpc-elec-intro}

The TPC Electronics System provides the ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)
