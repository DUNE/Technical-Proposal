\section{TPC Electronics System Overview}
\label{sec:fddp-tpc-elec-ov}

\fixme{Some initial text suggested by Anne (in fact the APA section in the protodune SP TDR has a lot of good descriptive text)}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-tpc-elec-intro}

The TPC Electronics System provides the ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

See Table~\ref{tab:dp-elecphysicsparams} for a list of the physics parameters that drive the design...
