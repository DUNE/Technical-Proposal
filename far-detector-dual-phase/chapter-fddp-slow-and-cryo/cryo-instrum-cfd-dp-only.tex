For \dual, additional care must be taken to monitor the gas phase above the liquid level as the temperature and pressure of argon gas affect gas pressure, and consequently the \dword{lem} calibration.  The gas pressure must be monitored to \SI{1}{mbar} precision and accuracy. In proximity to the liquid surface the temperature gradient of the  gas has to be measured with an array of temperature probes with a vertical pitch of about \SI{1}{cm}, and with a coarser \SI{5}{cm} pitch up to the cryostat roof. Each \dword{crp} is also equipped with \num{36} thermometers to sample the temperature across its structure.
