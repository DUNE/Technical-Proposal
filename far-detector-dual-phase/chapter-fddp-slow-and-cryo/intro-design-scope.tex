The \dword{cisc} system provides 
comprehensive monitoring for all \dword{detmodule} components as well as for the \lar quality and behavior, both being crucial
to guarantee high-quality of the data. Beyond passive monitoring, \dword{cisc} also provides a control system for some of the detector components. 
The structure of the \dword{cisc} consortium is quite complex. The subsystem chart
for the \dword{cisc} system in Figure~\ref{fig:sp-slow-cryo-subsys} shows the distinct 
 cryogenic instrumentation and slow controls branches. 
 
 The cryogenic instrumentation includes a set of devices 
to monitor the quality and behavior of the \lar volume in the cryostat interior, ensuring the correct functioning of
the full cryogenics system and the suitability of the \dword{lar} for good quality physics data. These devices are 
purity monitors, temperature monitors, gas analyzers, \lar level monitors, and cameras with their associated
light emitting system.

\end{dunefigure}



Cryogenic instrumentation also requires significant physics and
simulation work such as \efield simulations and cryogenics modeling
studies using \dfirst{cfd}. \efield simulations
are required to identify desirable locations for instrumentation
devices in the cryostat so that they are not in regions of high \efield and
that their presence does not induce large field distortions. \dshort{cfd}
% AC. What do we mean by distorsions here ?
% Alternative: ``that their designs do not induce high electric fields and risk of dielectric breakdown. ``
simulations are needed to understand the expected temperature,
impurity and velocity flow distributions and guide the placement and
distribution of instrumentation devices inside the cryostat.


From the organizational point of view, the 
cryogenic instrumentation has been divided into three main parts: (1) cryogenics systems, which includes all components directly related to the external cryogenics system as
liquid level monitoring, gas analyzers and internal cryogenic piping, all having substantial interfaces with LBNF; (2)  physics and simulation; and (3) \lar  instrumentation, which includes all
other instrumentation devices and a test facility for the devices. 

The second branch of \dword{cisc} is the slow controls system, in charge of monitoring and controlling most detector elements, including power supplies, electronics, racks, instrumentation devices, and  
calibration devices, etc. It includes four main components: hardware, infrastructure,
software, and firmware. The slow controls hardware and infrastructure consists of
networking hardware, signal processing hardware, computing hardware, and relevant
rack infrastructure. The slow controls software and firmware are needed for
signal processing, alarms, archiving, and control room displays.

%Two other systems have been included by the DUNE management as part of the \dword{cisc} consortium, a test facility for the instrumentation devices and the cryogenic piping inside the cryostat. Those are included inside the cryogenic instrumentation branch.

%The instrumentation work related to gas analyzers, liquid level
%monitors and internal cryogenic piping has significant
%interface with LBNF and will be coordinated between DUNE and LBNF.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fddp-slow-cryo-des-consid}

% specific to DP

For all \lar instrumentation devices, \dword{pddp} designs are
considered as the baseline, and requirements for most design
parameters are extrapolated from \dword{protodune}. Hence a critical step for
the \dword{cisc} consortium is to analyze data from \dword{protodune} once data sets become  available
to validate the instrumentation designs and understand their
performance. For example, noise induced by instrumentation devices on the readout electronics  can confuse the event reconstruction; the tolerable noise level from this source is a crucial design parameter that should be evaluated in \dword{protodune}.
%For example, a crucial design parameter that should be evaluated in \dword{protodune} is the maximum noise level induced by instrumentation devices on the readout electronics that can be tolerated to avoid confusing event reconstruction. 

Some of the common design considerations for
instrumentation devices include stability, reliability and longevity, 
such that the devices can survive for a period of at least \dunelifetime{}s.  Since it is uncommon for any device
to have such a long lifetime, provisions are made in the overall
design to allow replacement of devices where possible.

As for any other element inside the cryostat, 
the \efield on the instrumentation devices is 
required to be less than \SI{30}{kV\per\cm},
so that the risk of dielectric breakdown in \dword{lar} is minimized.
This requirement imposes stringent constraints on the location and mechanical 
design of some devices. Electrostatic simulations  
will be performed to compute the expected field on the boundaries of 
instrumentation devices and to design the appropriate \efield shielding
in the case the field approaches the limit. 

Another common consideration for all instrumentation devices is their support structure
design, which is expected to be substantially different from the one used in \dword{protodune}.

For slow controls, the system needs to be %designed such that it is 
robust enough to support a large number of monitored variables and a broad range of
monitoring and archiving rates. It must be capable %, and has the capability of 
interfacing 
with a large number of systems to establish two-way communication for
control and monitoring.

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:fddp-slow-cryo-scope}

% identical for SP and DP  %%  Dual-phase (Anne reviewed with SP)

As described above, and shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:sp-slow-cryo-subsys},
the scope of the \dword{cisc} system spans a broad range of activities.  In the
case of cryogenics systems (gas analyzers, liquid level monitors and
cryogenic internal piping), LBNF provides the needed expertise and
is responsible for the design, installation, and commissioning activities
while the \dword{cisc} consortium provides the resources as
needed. In the case of \lar Instrumentation devices (purity monitors,
thermometers, cameras and light-emitting system; and their associated \fdth{}s) and instrumentation
test facility, \dword{cisc} is responsible from design to commissioning in
the far \dwords{detmodule}.

From the slow controls side, \dword{cisc}  provides control and monitoring of
all detector elements that provide information on the health of the
\dword{detmodule} or conditions important to the experiment.
The scope of systems that slow controls includes is listed below:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Slow Controls Base Software and Databases}: provides the central tools needed to develop control and monitoring for various detector systems and interfaces.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base input/output software;
  \item Alarms, archiving, display panels, and operator interface tools; 
  \item Slow controls system documentation and operations guidelines.
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Slow Controls for External Systems}: export data from systems external to the detector and provide status to operators and archiving.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Beam status, cryogenics status, \dword{daq} status, and facilities systems status;
  \item For the systems above, import other interesting monitoring data as needed (e.g., pumps data from cryogenics system, heaters data from facility systems, etc.),
  \item Building controls, detector hall monitoring, and ground impedance monitoring; 
  \item Interlock status bit monitoring (but not the actual interlock mechanism).
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Slow Controls for Detector Hardware Systems}: develop software interfaces for detector hardware devices.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Monitoring and control of all power supplies; 
  \item Full rack monitoring (rack fans, thermometers and rack protection system);
  \item Instrumentation and calibration device monitoring (and control to the extent needed);
  \item Power distribution units monitoring, computer hardware monitoring;
  \item \dword{hv} system monitoring through cold cameras;
  \item Detector components inspection through warm cameras.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In terms of slow controls hardware, \dword{cisc}  develops, installs and
commissions any hardware related to rack monitoring and control. While
most power supplies might only need a cable from the device to an
Ethernet switch, some power supplies might need special cables (e.g., 
GPIB or RS232) for communication. The \dword{cisc} consortium is responsible for
providing such control cables.


In addition to the listed activities, \dword{cisc} also has activities that span
outside the scope of the consortium and require interfacing with other
groups. This is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-intfc}.

% More specific information on how \dword{cisc} scope of activities
% interface with other consortia can be found at DUNE Doc-dbs 6679 (\dword{apa}),
% 6730 (SP-PD), 6745 (SP-CE), 6760 (DP-\dword{crp}), 6781 (DP-PD), 6784 (DP-CE),
% 6787 (HV), and 6790 (\dword{daq}). The \dword{cisc} interface documents with facility,
% installation, integration, calibration, and physics can be found at DUNE
% Doc-dbs 6991, 7018, 7045, 7072, and 7099, respectively. The \dword{cisc}
