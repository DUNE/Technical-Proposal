\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-daq-intro}

The Data Acquisition System provides ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

See Table~\ref{tab:dp-daqphysicsparams} for a list of the physics parameters that drive the design...
