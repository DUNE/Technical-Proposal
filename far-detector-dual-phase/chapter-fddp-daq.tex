\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-daq-intro}

The Data Acquisition System provides ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\begin{dunefigure}[DP DAQ Overview]{fig:dp-daq-overview}
  {A generalized overview of high-level far detector \dword{daq}
    components showcasing the \dword{dp} \dword{detmodule}. 
    The electronics digitizes the detector signals and sends the data
    to the DAQ \dword{fe} readout hardware which sends the data to the
    \dword{fe} computing data receiver.
    The receiver sends the data to the \dword{ringbuffer} which is of
    sufficient size to retain the data long enough for a
    \dword{trigcommand} formed from the data itself to return.
    The receiver is also responsible to send out \dwords{trigcandidate} to the
    \dword{mtl} as input to forming a \dword{trigcommand}. 
    The \dword{mtl} forwards notification of this trigger process
    and accepts external \dwords{trigcandidate} from the \dword{gtl}.
    \Dwords{trigcommand} are then sent to the \dlong{eb} which queries
    the appropriate \dword{fe} computing units, aggregates the
    returned data and writes it to the \dword{diskbuffer} which is the
    interface to the Offline.}

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fddp-daq-des-consid}


The Data Acquisition System design must enable... 
...

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

See Table~\ref{tab:dp-daqphysicsparams} for a list of the physics parameters that drive the design...

\begin{dunetable}
[Important parameters for the DAQ system design]

{tab:dp-daqphysicsparams}
{Important parameters for the DAQ system design}   
Parameter  \\ \toprowrule
  \\ \colhline
   \\ \colhline
 ...\\ 
\end{dunetable}
\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

The scope of the Data Acquisition System includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item Photomulitplier tubes 
\item  ...
