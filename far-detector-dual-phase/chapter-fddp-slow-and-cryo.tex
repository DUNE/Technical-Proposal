\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-slow-cryo-intro}

The Slow Controls and Cryogenics Instrumentation system provides a
comprehensive monitoring and control system for all detector systems
and cryogenic instrumentation for the cryostat interior.\fixme{Write a better description.}
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:dp-cisc-pop}... (add figure)

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

\begin{dunetable}
[Important requirements on the system design]

\end{dunetable}

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}
