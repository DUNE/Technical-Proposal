\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-slow-cryo-intro}

The Slow Controls and Cryogenics Instrumentation provides the bias voltage to the CPAs to create the \SI{500}{V/cm} drift field...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)
