\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fddp-hv-intro}

The High Voltage System provides the bias voltage to the CRPs to create the \SI{500}{V/cm} drift field...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figure-label}.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

See Table~\ref{tab:dp-hvphysicsparams} for a list of the physics parameters that drive the design...

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

The scope of the HV system includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item field cage
\item power supplies 
\item feedthroughs, ...
