%As well as the moral obligation to avoid harming anyone, there are laws that require machines to be safe, and sound economic reasons for avoiding accidents. 
Safety must be taken into account right from the design stage and must be kept in mind at all stages in the life of a machine: design, manufacture, installation, adjustment, operation, and maintenance. In the UK, machines have to comply with the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) listed in Annex I of the Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC), thus setting a common minimum level of protection across the EEA (European Economic Area).
