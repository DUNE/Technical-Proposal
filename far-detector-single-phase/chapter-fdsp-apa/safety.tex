\section{Safety}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-safety}

Building on the experience of ProtoDUNE, a full safety analysis will be performed and a set of safe work procedures developed for all stages of the fabrication process before the start of DUNE APA production.  In the final design of the winding machine, central to the production process, safety must be taken into account right from the design stage and must be kept in mind at all stages in the life of the machine: design, manufacture, installation, adjustment, operation, and maintenance.  Handling of the large, but delicate frames is a major challenge and safe procedures will be developed for all phases of construction, including frame assembly, wiring, transport, and integration and installation in the cryostat.         

At the factory sites, safety is ultimately the responsibility of the host institutions, and all local rules and regulations must be followed.  However, common job hazard analysis can be performed and documents prepared for many shared aspects of the tooling and activities.  In addition, safety will be an important element of production readiness reviews that are conducted for the project overall and for the factory sites individually.
