\subsection{APA Consortium Organization}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-consortium}
The APA Consortium comprises 21 institutions, of which 13 from the US, 7 from the UK, and one from the Czech Republic. The Consortium is organized along the main deliverables, which are the final design of the APA and the APA production and assembly procedures. Since the two main centers for APA construction are expected to be located in the US and the UK, there are usually two leaders of each working group, representing the main stakeholders (Fig.~\ref{fig:APAorg}). This is particularly important to ensure that common procedures and tooling are developed. 

%\fixme{I asked Maxine about standardized org charts for each consortium. It would be nice to have these. Anne}

\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fdsp-apa-org-assmp}
The planning assumptions are based on having 8-9 APA assembly lines, at different locations in the UK and the US. It will take of the order 50 shifts to construct a single APA. Assuming a multi-shift system, we will be able to construct the 150 APAs required for one 10 kt module within two years.
