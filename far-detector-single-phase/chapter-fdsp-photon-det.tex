\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-intro}
\fixme{\color{blue} Content: Segreto}

The Photon Detection System provides ...

\fixme{In the TP introduction there should be a statement concerning the photon collector options under consideration and the timeline and procedure for making a selection.}

The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\fixme{\color{blue} Content: Segreto/Warner/Mualem}

The Photon Detection system design must enable... 
...

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  


\begin{dunetable}

Requirement  \\ \toprowrule

   \\ \colhline
 ...\\ 
\end{dunetable}

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-scope}
\fixme{\color{blue} Content: Segreto/Warner/Mualem}

The scope of the Photon Detection system includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item Photon Collectors 
\item SiPMs
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Photon Collector}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-pc}
\fixme{\color{blue} Content: Cavanna/Whittington/Machado}

At the time of the Technical Proposal there are three photon collector options  under consideration, in the following we summarize the design and development status for each. [For the Technical Design Report there will be a baseline design and an alternate.]

\subsubsection{Hybrid or New Options (2 pages)}
\label{ssec:fdsp-pd-pc-new}

\subsection{New Techniques to Supplement or Enhance Light Yield}
\label{sec:fdsp-pd-enh}
\fixme{\color{blue} Content: Cavanna/Whittington/Machado}

The Technical Proposal and TDR may include proposals to augment the capabilities of the photon
collector modules. In the case that the hardware requirements for such proposals would pose a minimal
impact on the detector design, additional R\&D beyond the timescale of the TDR may be required since it may impact the second 10~kt module if not the first. 
Some examples include:
\begin{itemize}
\item TPB-Coated Reflector Foils (Szelc)
\item Xenon-Doped LAr (Escobar/Para)
\item TPB-Doped LAr (Escobar)
\end{itemize}
