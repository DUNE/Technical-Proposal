TEST WITH ANNE
The Photon Detection System provides ...

\fixme{In the TP introduction there should be a statement concerning the photon collector options under consideration and the timeline and procedure for making a selection.}

The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)
