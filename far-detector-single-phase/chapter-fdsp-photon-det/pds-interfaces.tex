The Technical Proposal may include any suggestions or requests from the Photon Detector Consortium
for changes to the APA design. Any such changes need to be proposed as early as possible to ensure
consideration within the APA Consortium's schedule. Some examples include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Additional light collector bays
\item Alternate outer APA designs
\end{itemize}
