\section{Project Support}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-supp}

The DUNE Project is coordinated by Technical Coordination. The DUNE
Project consists of a Far Detector and a Near Detector. The Near
Detector is at a pre-conceptual state; as the Conceptual Design and
organization emerges, it will become part of the DUNE
Project. Currently the DUNE Project consists of the DUNE Far Detector
Consortia and Technical Coordination.
