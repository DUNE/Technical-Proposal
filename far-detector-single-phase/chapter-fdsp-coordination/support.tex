\section{Project Support}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-supp}

The DUNE Project is coordinated by Technical Coordination (TC). The DUNE
Project consists of a Far Detector (FD) and a Near Detector (ND). The Near
Detector is at a pre-conceptual state; as the Conceptual Design and
organization emerges, it will become part of the DUNE
Project. Currently the DUNE Project consists of the DUNE Far Detector
Consortia and Technical Coordination.

As defined in the DUNE Management Plan (DMP), the DUNE Technical Board (TB) is
the technical decision making body for the collaboration. It consists
of all consortia scientific and technical leads. It reports through
the Executive Board (EB) to Collaboration Management. The DUNE Technical
Board is chaired by the Technical Coordinator.

\subsection{Project Controls}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-controls}

Technical Coordination Project Controls (PC) maintains a web page
(currently located at
{https://web.fnal.gov/collaboration/DUNE/DUNE\%20Project/\_layouts/15/start.aspx\#/})
with links to project documents. Technical Coordination maintains
repositories of project documents and drawings. These include the WBS,
Schedule, risk register, requirements, milestones, strategy, detector
models and drawings that define the DUNE detector.

In order to insure that the DUNE detector remains on schedule, TC
project controls will monitor schedule statusing from each Consortium,
will organize reviews of the schedules and risks as appropriate. PC
will maintain a master schedule that links all Consortia schedules and
contains appropriate milestones to monitor progress.

\subsection{Reviews}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-reviews}

Technical Coordination is responsible to review all stages of detector
development and works with each Consortium to arrange reviews of the
design, production readiness, production progress and operational
readiness of their system.  These reviews provide input for the TB to
make technical decisions.  Review reports are tracked by TC and
provide guidance as to key issues that will require engineering
oversight by TC.

\subsection{Quality Assurance}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-qa}

The DUNE Quality Assurance program is described in the LBNF/DUNE
Quality Assurance Plan. This plan is maintained by the LBNF/DUNE
Quality Assurance Manager (QAM), who reports to the TC. The QAM is
responsible to work with the Consortia in developing their QA
plans. The QAM is responsible to review QC activity as appropriate,
including production site visits.

\subsection{ES\&H}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-esh}

The DUNE Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) program is described
in the LBNF/DUNE Integrated Environmental, Safety and Health
Plan. This plan is maintained by the LBNF/DUNE ESH Manager, who
reports to the TC. The ESH is responsible to work with the Consortia
in reviewing their hazards and their ESH plans.  The ESH Manager is
responsible to review ESH at production sites, integration sites and
at SURF.
