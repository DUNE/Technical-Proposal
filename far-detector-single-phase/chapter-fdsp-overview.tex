\section{Description}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-model}

The DUNE \dword{spmod} features a \nominalmodsize active mass \lartpc, with all associated cryogenic, electronic readout, computing, and safety systems.  The \dword{spmod} is designed to maximize the active volume within the confines of the membrane cryostat while minimizing dead regions.  The detector elements have been modularized such that their production can proceed in parallel with the construction of the DUNE caverns and cryostats, and sized so that they conform to the access restrictions for transport underground.  Table~\ref{tab:dune-sp-parameters} summarizes some of the high-level parameters of the \dword{spmod}.

The cryostat is constructed such that its long axis is aligned with the beam arriving from \fnal.  The TPC  inside the cryostat is composed of two rows of \dwords{cpa} oriented along the long axis of the cryostat, flanked on either side by rows of \dwords{apa}.  A \dword{fc} completely surrounds the four
open sides of the four drift regions to ensure that the \efield within is uniform and unaffected by the presence of the cryostat walls and other nearby conductive structures.  Integrated within each \dword{apa} are elements of the \dword{pds} as well as electronics to process the \dword{apa} signals.  Around the periphery of the TPC various instrumentation for monitoring the cryogenic environment is present.  Outside of the cryostat, additional electronic readout and data acquisition equipment is present to transfer information from the \dword{detmodule}.  Figure~\ref{fig:dune-sp-overview} illustrates the basic arrangement of the TPC elements within the \dword{spmod}.

\section{Detector Systems}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-sys}


%The elements composing the DUNE-SP detector module include the time projection chamber (TPC), the cold electronics (\dword{ce}), and the photon detection system (\dword{pds}).  The TPC components, e.g., anode planes, cathode planes and the field cage, are designed in a modular way.  
%The six \dwords{apa} are arranged into two \dword{apa} planes, each consisting of three side-by-side \dwords{apa}. Between them,  
%a central cathode plane, composed of 18 \dword{cpa} modules, splits the TPC volume into two electron-drift regions, one on each side of the cathode plane.

\subsection{Anode Plane Assemblies}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-apa}

The \dword{apa} system, described in full detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-apa}, is used to capture the signals created by ionization drifting in the TPC volume.  Each \dword{apa} features a metal frame, on each side of which there are three instrumented and two uninstrumented anode layers.  The design of the anode layers is arranged to provide three complementary views of the ionization present in the TPC that can be combined to form \threed representations of the distribution of the charge in the \dword{spmod}.  

Among the novel features of the \single \lartpc are the presence of wrapped anode wires that follow a helical trajectory around the height of the \dword{apa}.  This design choice was made to minimize the need to tile electronic readout around the perimeter of the \dword{apa}, which would lead to dead space between neighboring \dwords{apa}.  This choice also was driven by reconstruction performance, with the angle of the wrap chosen such that a given induction plane wire does not intersect a given collection plane wire more than once, which greatly reduces pathologies in pattern recognition. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{TPC Electronics}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-elec}

The electronics system, described in full detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-tpc-elec}, is responsible for manipulating the signals present on the \dword{apa} wires and ultimately transferring them out of the cryostat and on to the \dword{daq} system.  The first stage of low-noise electronics in the experiment are located directly on the end of the \dword{apa}, where the ionization signals are initially shaped and amplified before further processing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{CPA, Field Cage and High Voltage}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-hv}

The \dword{hv} system, described in full detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-hv}, creates the uniform electric field in the TPC volume that causes ionization to drift towards the \dwords{apa}.  The \dword{hv} system contains both the \dwords{cpa}, which are operated at a 
voltage of \SI{-180}{kV}, as well as the \dword{fc} elements which progressively step the \dword{cpa} voltage down in magnitude.  

Among the novel features of the \single \lartpc is the use of resistive panels for the \dwords{cpa}, which serves to control the flow of stored energy in the \dword{hv} system in the event of an unexpected electrical discharge.  This features provides protection to the \dword{spmod} elements and guards against damage that would negatively impact detector performance.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Photon Detection}
\label{sec:fdsp-ov-pds}

The \dword{pds}, described in full detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:fdsp-pd}, is used to capture scintillation light produced by interactions in the TPC.  The scintillation light of argon is very deep in the ultraviolet, so the \dword{pd} elements are designed to shift this wavelength closer to the visible spectrum where the \dword{spmod} has high efficiency.
