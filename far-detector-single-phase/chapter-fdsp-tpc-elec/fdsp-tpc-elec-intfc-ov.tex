Some of the components designed and built by the CE consortium are
mounted or need to work together with detector components provided by other DUNE
consortia. Interface documents have been developed to ensure that the boundaries
between systems are fully understood and that no detector components is missed or
not properly defined when organizing the detector construction project into
consortia. These interface documents are a work in progress. With time they will
evolve into a very detailed definition of mechanical and electrical interfaces,
including in some cases the description of data transmission protocols. These
interface documents include a list of the responsibilities of each consortium during the
R\&D, design, and prototyping phase, and discuss also all the procedures to be
followed during the integration of detector components and the following testing
and commissioning process. In some cases multiple consortia (APA, PDS, HV, CISC,
and DAQ) can be involved, depending on the complexity and maturity of the test
setup.

The most important interfaces for the CE consortium are with the APA and DAQ
consortia, followed by those with the PDS, HV, and CISC~consortia. One of the most
important aspects of all these interfaces is the enforcement of appropriate grounding rules
and of the physical separation between electrical circuits to minimize the noise and
cross-talk between different detector components. Different APAs should be electrically
insulated, and the same should apply for the photon detection system and the
CE readout of the anode planes. The flanges on the chimneys are used to provide,
separately for the two APAs and for the photon detector system, the reference
voltage for all the detector elements. The flanges are electrically connected
to the cryostat structure that acts as the detector ground. The same approach
has to be implemented also for the CISC instrumentation in the LAr.

Below the two most complex interfaces to the TPC electronics subsystem, the
interfaces to the APAs and DAQ, are discussed in more detail.
