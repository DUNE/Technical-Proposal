ProtoDUNE-SP is intended to be a full slice of the DUNE far detector as near as possible to the final DUNE Single Phase design. It will instrument 6 full-size DUNE APAs with 20 FEMB each for a total readout channel count of 15,360 digitized sense wires. Critically, the CE on each APA will be read out via a full CE read out system, via a CE flange and WIEC with 5 WIBs and 1 PTC. Each APA will also have a full Photon Detector readout system installed.

Once each APA has been validated in the cold box at CERN, it will be installed in the ProtoDUNE-SP cryostat. Any issues that are discovered either during the cold box tests or the ProtoDUNE-SP commissioning and data-taking will be incorporated into the next iteration of the system design for DUNE.

In addition to the tests described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-qa-facilities-coldbox}, tests have also been done on the ProtoDUNE-SP APA to check for any additional noise introduced on the TPC wire readout by operating the PD system or enabling the wire-bias HV system. So far, no significant increase in the noise on the APA wire readout has been observed when operating these other systems.
