The \dword{ce} consortium provides all of the electronics used for reading out the charge
collection and induction signals produced on the \dword{apa} wires by particles that ionize
the \lar. The \dword{apa} consortium
is responsible for all of the printed circuit boards mounted on the \dword{apa} frame
holding the anode wires. These boards provide filtering of the wire bias voltages,
connection of the bias voltages to the wires and AC or direct coupling of the
wire signals to the \dwords{femb} built by the \dword{ce} consortium.
The cold boxes containing the \dwords{femb} are also mounted on the \dwords{apa} and are connected
electrically to the CR boards. The \dword{ce} consortium is responsible for providing the bias
voltage to the \dwords{apa}, and also the bias voltage for the electron diverters and the \dword{fe} termination electrodes (these last two items are part of the interface with
the \dword{hv} consortium).

A crucial aspect of the interface between the \dword{ce} and \dword{apa} consortia
is the choice of routing for the cables that provide power, control, and readout
for the bottom \dword{apa}. Studies are ongoing to understand whether it is feasible to
route these cables inside the \dword{apa} frames of the two stacked \dwords{apa}, and whether it
is necessary to modify the size of the \dword{apa} frame in order to achieve this goal.
Mockups of the \dword{apa} frames will be used for routing tests together with \dword{pdsp}
cables, under the assumption that there will be minimal changes in the cross
section of cables between \dword{pdsp} and DUNE (we expect to be able to remove one
of the seven pairs of power lines used in \dword{pdsp}, when the \dword{fpga} on the
\dword{femb} is replaced by the \dword{coldata} \dword{asic}). Before spring 2019 we expect to perform
a realistic test of the cable insertion in a pair of stacked \dwords{apa} using
mechanical prototypes (i.e.,~without wires) of the \dword{apa}. We are also investigating
the possibility of routing the cables for the bottom \dword{apa} outside the field
cage, which increases significantly the length of the cables for the central
\dword{apa}; this also complicates the installation procedure and the engineering of the
support structures inside the cryostat.
