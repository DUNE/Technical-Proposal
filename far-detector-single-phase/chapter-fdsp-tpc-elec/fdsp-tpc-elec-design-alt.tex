In addition to the baseline \dword{femb} and \dword{asic} designs discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-femb}, %there are 
two other \dword{femb} and \dword{asic} options are currently under consideration. %being considered, as well.  
There is one official alternative design, the SLAC nEXO three-chip \textit{CRYO} \dword{asic}, and one fallback option for the \dword{adc} \dword{asic}, the Columbia University ATLAS-style \dword{adc} \dword{asic}.  These options are described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-alt-cryo} and Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-alt-atlas}, respectively.
