In addition to the baseline FEMB and ASIC designs discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-femb}, there are other FEMB and ASIC options currently being considered as well.  There is one official alternative design, the SLAC-designed nEXO three-chip ``CRYO'' ASIC, and one fallback option for the ADC ASIC, the Columbia-led ATLAS-style ADC ASIC.  These options are described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-alt-cryo} and Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-design-alt-atlas}, respectively.
