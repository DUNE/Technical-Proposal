A ``cold box'' at CERN used in electronics tests for ProtoDUNE-SP is available for electronics testing in cold argon gas. The cold box is designed to cycle one full-size DUNE APA with the full compliment of 20 FEMB through gaseous nitrogen temperatures around 150K to check out the APA performance prior to installing the APA into the ProtoDUNE-SP cryostat. It is designed to be a Faraday cage identical to the ProtoDUNE-SP cryostat and is read out by a complete CE system for a single APA, including a CE flange and fully-loaded WIEC with 5 WIBs and 1 PTC.

Preliminary results from the ProtoDUNE-SP cold box indicate that
the noise performance of the TPC readout will satisfy the DUNE FD noise requirements of
ENC~<~1000e$^-$ on DUNE length wires. These measurements suggest that the noise level in
LAr would be around 500e$^-$ and 600e$^-$ for the collection and induction plane channels,
respectively; this is well below the requirement.  The ENC and temperature of APA2 in the
Cold Box are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cb_results}.
