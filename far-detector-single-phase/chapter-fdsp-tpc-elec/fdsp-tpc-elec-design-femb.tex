The main component of the CE architecture, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ce-scheme}, is the 
128-channel FEMB, which itself consists of an analog motherboard and an attached COLDATA 
mezzanine card for processing the digital outputs.
Each APA is instrumented with 20 FEMBs, for a total of 2,560 channels per APA.
The FEMBs plug directly into the APA CR boards, making the connections from the U- and V-plane induction wires and 
X-plane collection wires to the charge amplifier circuits as short as possible.
