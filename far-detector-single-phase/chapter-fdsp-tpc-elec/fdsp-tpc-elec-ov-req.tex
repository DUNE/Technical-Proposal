In addition to the noise requirement (less than \num{1000}\,$e^{-}$), several additional requirements determine most of the other important TPC electronics specifications.  These are:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The \dword{fe} peaking time shall %should 
be \numrange{1}{3}\,\si{\micro\second}.  This requirement is derived primarily from the time required for drifting charges to travel from one plane of anode wires to the next.}
\item{The \dword{fe} shall %should 
 have an adjustable baseline.  This requirement reflects the fact that the signal from induction wires is bipolar while the signal from the collection wires is mostly unipolar.}
\item{The \dword{adc} sampling frequency shall %should 
be \SI{2}{MHz}.  This value is chosen to match a \dword{fe} shaping time of \SI{1}{\micro\second} (approximate Nyquist condition) while minimizing the data rate.}
\item{The system shall %must 
have a linear response up to an impulse input of at least \num{530000}\,$e^{-}$.  This roughly corresponds to the charge collected on a single wire from one stopping proton and two more highly ionizing protons, all assumed to have trajectories at \num{45}\,$^{\circ}$ with respect to the beam axis.  This number was chosen so that saturation will occur in less than \numrange{5}{10}\,\% of beam related events.  Studies are ongoing (including an evaluation of \lariat~\cite{Cavanna:2014iqa} data and simulation studies) to better understand this requirement.}
\item{The dynamic range of the system must be at least \num{3000}:\num{1}. This number is given by the ratio between (the maximum signal for no saturation) and $\sim$50\% of the lowest possible noise level.  It implies a \num{12}-bit \dword{adc}.}
\item{The effective noise that the \dword{adc} adds to the \dword{fe} noise shall %must 
be insignificant.  This requirement is dependent on the gain of the \dword{fe}, but for each gain setting translates into requirements on \dword{adc} parameters including non-linearity and noise.}
\item{The power dissipated by the electronics located in the \lar shall %must 
be less than \SI{50}{mW/channel}.  Lower power dissipation is desirable because the mass of the power cables scales with the power.  Studies are ongoing to understand if the amount of power dissipated by the electronics should be minimized further due to potential complications from argon boiling; in principle this should not be a problem because the \dword{ce} boxes housing the \dwords{femb} are designed to channel bubbles to the \dword{apa} frames.}
\end{itemize}

Finally, all electronics located in the \lar shall %must 
be highly reliable because it will not be possible to access the \dword{ce} for repair once the cryostat is filled with \lar. Studies are ongoing to quantify the impact of failures in the TPC and electronics, including single wire failures, and failures of groups of \num{16}, \num{64}, or \num{128} channels.

% A number of risks associated with the \dword{ce} (or their integration with another subsystem) are detailed below:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item{failures in the TPC and electronics, including single wire failures and failures of groups of 16, 64, or 128 channels;}
%\item{electrical failures associated with having two \dwords{apa} vertically chained together;}
%\item{problems in the final \dword{adc} \dword{asic} design that are not able to be resolved in time for installation at the \dword{spmod};}
%\item{issues associated with having cables longer than those that will be tested at \dword{pdsp};}
%\item{potential ground loops in the \dword{spmod};}
%\item{difficulty keeping the electronics power level low enough as to avoid significant boiling of the argon; and}
%\item{bubbles associated with any boiling of the argon leading to electrical breakdown within the detector, which may damage the electronics.}
%\end{itemize}

%Studies associated with better understanding these risks and means to minimize them are ongoing and will be discussed in a future document.

%The core components of the TPC electronics subsystem are the \dword{femb} \dwords{asic} that perform shaping, digitization, and multiplexing of channel data in the cold.  Two basic requirements for the \dword{asic} designs are:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{negligible risk of failure due to the hot carrier effect (less than 0.7\% channel failure per \dword{apa} plane in 30 years of operation); and}
%\item{a total power consumption of less than 50~mW/channel.}
%\end{itemize}
%If multiple \dword{asic} designs meet these two requirements, the down-select decision will be based on performance, power consumption, estimated reliability, and estimated cost.  Of these factors, performance will be given the largest weight.
%
%For the FE \dwords{asic}, more specific requirements include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{less than 1000e$^-$ equivalent noise charge (\dword{enc}) in \lar for the induction channels;}
%\item{baseline recovery for large pulses;}
%\item{crosstalk between neighboring channels below the 2\% level;}
%\item{crosstalk between non-neighboring channels well below the 1\% level;}
%\item{a nonlinearity below the 0.5\% level or precisely characterized; and}
%\item{channel-to-channel gain uniformity that is either negligible or precisely characterized.}
%\end{itemize}
%A secondary performance measurement is dynamic range.  If noise or linearity depends on the gain setting, then most weight (90\%) will be given to the setting with best performance for which an impulse of 85~fC at the input does not saturate the output.
%
%Additional \dword{adc} \dword{asic} requirements are:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{an associated noise level that is less than 0.5 least significant bits (LSB);}
%\item{a usable dynamic range of at least 3000:1;}
%\item{differential nolinearity (DNL) that is less than 1 LSB; and}
%\item{integrated nonlinearity (INL) that is either less than 1 LSB or consistent from channel-to-channel and chip-to-chip.}
%\end{itemize}
%
%Finally, specific requirements of the \dword{coldata} \dword{asic} design include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{fully functional at both room temperature and \lar temperature; and}
%\item{both control and data links must operate with negligible error rate over cables up to 21~m in length.}
%\end{itemize}
%
%In addition to these requirements on the \dwords{asic}, the TPC electronics subsystem must also:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{provide the means to read out the TPC wires and transmit their data in a useful format to the DAQ;}
%\item{operate for the life of the facility without significant loss of function;}
%\item{record the channel waveforms continuously without dead time;}
%\item{be constructed only from materials that are compatible with high-purity \lar;}
%\item{provide sufficient precision and range in the digitization to discriminate electrons from photon conversions, optimize the reconstruction of high-energy and low-energy tracks from accelerator-neutrino interactions, distinguish a minimum-ionizing particle (MIP) from noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 9:1 or greater, and measure ionization up to 15 times that of a MIP so that stopping kaons from proton decay can be identified;}
%\item{ensure that all poewr supplies have local monitoring and control, remote monitoring and control through the DAQ, and over-current and over-voltage protection circuits; and}
%\item{ensure that the \dword{ce} \fdths are able to withstand twice their nominal operating voltages with a maximum specified leakage current in 1-atm argon gas.}
%\end{itemize}
%
%The quality assurance (QA) process, described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-qa}, will make use of both initial validation procedures using electronics test stands as well as integrated test facilities in order to ensure that final component designs satisfy the above requirements.  Once component designs have been decided upon, the quality control (QC) process will employ similar requirements to make sure that every component to be installed in the DUNE \single \dword{spmod} is up to standard.  This is described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-qc}.
