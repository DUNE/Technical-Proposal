A preliminary list of milestones indicating the current planning for the completion
of the design, R\&D, and engineering phase, and then later for the production setup
and the production, integration, and installation activities is shown in Table~\ref{tab:CEmilestones}.
A detailed schedule of all the activities will be prepared in the coming months,
with the goal of allowing for a third iteration in the design of ASICs, if needed,
and for a float of a few months in the completion of the integration of the FEMBs
with the APAs, and later for the installation of the APAs in the first DUNE cryostat,
prior to the closing of the TCO.
