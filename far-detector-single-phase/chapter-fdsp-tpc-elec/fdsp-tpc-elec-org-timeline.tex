A preliminary list of milestones indicating the current planning for the completion
of the design, R\&D, and engineering phase, and then later for the production setup
and the production, integration, and installation activities is shown in Table~\ref{tab:ce-milestones}.
This list of milestones corresponds to a scenario in which only two iterations in
the design of the \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb} are required, and results in a float of nine months
for the integration of the \dword{ce} with the \dwords{apa}. In the case that a third
iteration is required, the availability of the \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb} could introduce a 
delay in the overall schedule of the \dword{spmod}. 
A detailed schedule of all of the activities will be prepared in the coming months,
with the goal of having a better estimate of the critical path for the project
under different assumptions on the number of design iterations for the \dwords{asic} and \dwords{femb}.
