\subsection{Scope and Requirements}
\label{sec:fdsp-tpc-elec-ov-scope}

The scope of the TPC Electronics system includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item power supplies 
\item feedthroughs, ...
