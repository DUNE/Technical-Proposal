\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-intro}

The Data Acquisition System provides ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

The Data Acquisition System design must enable...

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

\begin{dunetable}
[Important requirements on the DAQ system design]

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-scope}

The scope of the Data Acquisition System includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item SiPMs 
\item  ...
