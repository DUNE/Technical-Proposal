\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-hv-intro}

The High Voltage System provides the bias voltage to the CPAs to create the \SI{500}{V/cm} drift field...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\fixme{Include an image of the overall system, indicating its parts. Show how the system fits into the overall detector.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:fdsp-hv-scope}

The scope of the HV system includes the continued procurement of materials for, and the fabrication, testing, delivery and installation of the following systems: 

\fixme{Whatever the items are...}

\begin{itemize}
\item cathode plane assemblies (CPAs)
\item field cage
\item power supplies 
\item feedthroughs, ...
\end{itemize}
