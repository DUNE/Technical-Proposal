\fixme{Some initial text suggested by Anne (in fact the APA section in the protodune SP TDR has a lot of good descriptive text)}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-install-intro}

The Installation and Integration (activity/team/effort?) for the single-phase detector module provides the ...
The (activity/organization/effort?)includes (whatever it includes)....

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-install-des-consid}


%%%%%  Design to identify MIPs -- wire pitch and other params
The Installation and Integration activity design must enable...

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document  when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

\begin{dunetable}
[Important requirements on the design]
{p{0.8\textwidth}}
{apaphysicsparams}
{Important requirements on the design}   
Requirement  \\ \toprowrule
  \\ \colhline
   \\ \colhline
 ...\\ 
\end{dunetable}

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:fdsp-install-scope}

The scope of the Installation and Integration effort includes the ...  installation and integration of the following systems:
