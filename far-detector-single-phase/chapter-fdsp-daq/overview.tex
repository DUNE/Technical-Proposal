\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-intro}

The Data Acquisition System provides ...
The system includes (whatever it includes), as shown in Figure.... 

\metainfo{Include a figure drawn in terms of Sec~\ref{sec:fdsp-daq-design} aand with ``boxes'' roughly at the granularity of its sub-sections.}

The operating principle is illustrated in Figure~\ref{figure-label}... (add figure)

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-des-consid}


\metainfo{Include: Raw data rate from WIBs, Josh's table of data volumes for each event type and the 30 PB/year offline limit. Space and thermal power limits.}


The Data Acquisition System design must enable... 
...

\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  

\begin{dunetable}
[Important requirements on the DAQ system design]

{Important requirements on the DAQ system design}   
Requirement  \\ \toprowrule
  \\ \colhline
   \\ \colhline
 ...\\ 
\end{dunetable}

\fixme{By the end of the volume, for every requirement listed in this section, there should exist an explanation of how it will be satisfied.}
