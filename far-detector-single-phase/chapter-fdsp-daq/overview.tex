\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-intro}

The DUNE Far Detector (FD) Single-Phase Data Acquisition (DAQ) System
design must enable the readout, processing and distribution to
permanent storage of physics and calibration data from each 10~kton SP
module, including data from the PD, TPC, accelerator and timing,
calibration, and other auxiliary systems.
An overview of the overall DUNE FD DAQ System is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:daq-overview}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:daq-overview} illustrates the main DAQ subsystem
components as well as the data flow and the exchange of trigger and
monitoring messages between them.
As shown, it is applicable to both TPC and PD system readout, except
that in the case of the PD system the DAQ scope begins to the right of
the Front-End Readout.

  {A generalized overview of high-level far detector \dword{daq}
    components showcasing the \dword{sp} \dword{detmodule}. 
    The electronics digitizes the detector signals and sends the data
    to the DAQ \dword{fe} readout hardware which sends the data to the
    \dword{fe} computing data receiver.
    The \dword{fe} readout hardware also processes the data stream to
    produce \dwords{trigprimitive} which are sent along with the data
    itself.
    The receiver sends the data to the \dword{ringbuffer} which is of
    sufficient size to retain the data long enough for a
    \dword{trigcommand} formed from the data itself to return.
    The receiver is also responsible to send out
    \dwords{trigcandidate}, formed from the \dwords{trigprimitive}, to
    the \dword{mtl} as input to forming a \dword{trigcommand}. 
    The \dword{mtl} forwards notification of this trigger process and
    accepts external \dwords{trigcandidate} from the \dword{gtl}.
    \Dwords{trigcommand} are then sent to the \dlong{eb} which queries
    the appropriate \dword{fe} computing units, aggregates the
    returned data and writes it to the \dword{diskbuffer} which is the
    interface to the Offline.}

\subsection{Design Considerations}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-des-consid}


%\metainfo{Include: Raw data rate from WIBs, Josh's table of data volumes for each event type and the 30 PB/year offline limit. Space and thermal power limits.  Note, this table may be better put into Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-daq-design} to make this section more generic.}

%\fixme{Anne suggests: Within this section add ref to requirements document when it's ready, and maybe list the most important half dozen in a table here). E.g.,}  
The high level requirements for the DUNE FD DAQ are provided in
\cite{daq:reqs}.
The most critical requirements in consideration for the overall design
are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:daqrequirements}.

The data rates and thus the processing needs of the DAQ are expected
to be dominated by the TPC system.
In particular, the DAQ must be designed to handle (receive, process,
compress, select, and hand off to back-end computing) raw TPC data
rates of up to \SI{6.14}{\TB/\s}. 
This rate assumes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Four (4) \SI{10}{\kton} Single Phase (SP) TPC detector modules
\item 150 Anode Plane Assemblies (APAs) per module
\item 2560 wire channels per APA (800 Induction 1, 800 Induction 2, and 960 Collection wires)
\item 2 MHz digitization rate
\item 2 Bytes per sample (note that this is an overestimate, as data will be digitized with a 12-bit ADC)
\end{itemize}
\fixme{We need to standardize plane labeling throughout.  With the above, there are now \textbf{four} standards (also u/v/w, u/v/x and u/v/y).}

A back-end requirement is that the total volume of physics data that
can be shipped to off-site data centers for offline analysis is
limited to \SI{100}{\Gbps}.
An additional requirement is that a yearâ€™s worth of data amounts to no
more than \SI{30}{\PB} of data to permanent disk per year for the
entire DUNE FD, including all four (4) \SI{10}{\kton}
\dwords{detmodule} (each including TPC, PD system, calibration
systems, etc.).

The anticipated event rates due to true physics signals per
\SI{10}{\kton} \dword{detmodule} are summarized in
Tab.~\ref{tab:daqdatarates}, under the assumption that noise levels
(which can otherwise generate an overwhelming rate of fake triggers)
are as expected from intrinsic electronics noise.

Scalability & The DUNE FD DAQ shall be capable of receiving and

"normal" operating conditions \\ \colhline
Triggering & The DUNE FD DAQ shall provide full-detector triggering
functionality as well as self-triggering
functionality; the data selection shall maintain high efficiency to
physics events while operating within a total bandwidth of 30 PB/year
for all operating FD modules \\ \colhline

different FD modules to within 1~$\mu$s, and of different subsystems
within a module to within 10~ns\\ \colhline
