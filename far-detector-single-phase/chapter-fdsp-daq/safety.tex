Two overall safety plans will be followed by the FD-DAQ.  Work
underground will comply with the safety procedures in place for working
in the detector caverns and CUC underground at SURF.  In particular,
procedures for working with racks full of electronics and/or computers
as done at Fermilab will be followed.  \footnote{which we should cite somehow}

There are not any special safety items for the DAQ system that are not
already covered by the more general safety plans referenced above.
