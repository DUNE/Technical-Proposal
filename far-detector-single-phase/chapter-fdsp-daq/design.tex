Here we describe the overall readout and data acquistion
strategy. This will include the high-level data flow diagram,
(Figure~\ref{fig:daq-readout-buffering-baseline} may be sufficient)
which is divided in functional boxes, each of which are described in
turn in the sections below.

\subsection{Local Readout \& Buffering (Giles Barr \& Giovanna Miotto \& Brett Viren)}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-ltr}

\metainfo{Describe how the data is received from the detector electronics, and buffered while awaiting a trigger decision, together with any processing that affects stored data.  The starting point is data incoming from the WIBs and the end point is corresponding data sitting in memory ready for event building. }

Figure~\ref{fig:daq-readout-buffering-baseline} illustrates the local
readout and buffering data flow in the context of a single APA.  

\begin{dunefigure}[Baseline Readout and Buffering]{fig:daq-readout-buffering-baseline}
  {Illustration of data flow for two out of 150 APAs in the

    It shows the Cold Electronics WIB-RCE connections which send one
    half of one APA face to each RCE. 
    The data and L0 trigger primitives the RCEs are received by a
    single FELIX host. 
    The data is buffered into RAM and the trigger primitives are sent
    to the Module Trigger Logic unit (MTL) and sent to the Global
    Trigger Logic unit (not shown). 
    Nominal (non-dump) trigger commands are delivered to the Event
    Builder which polls the selector on the appropriate FELIX host for
    the requested data.
    The MTL sends special SNB-dump trigger commands directly to the
    Front-End Readout hardware so that it may initiate a full-stream
    dump to local storage. 
    This dump is then sent out over Ethernet to a special SNB Event
    builder. 
    Both types of event builders finally save triggered data to file
    on the offline buffer disk.}

\subsection{Local Trigger Primitive Generation (Josh Klein \& J.J. Russel \& Brett Viren \& DP Expert?)}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-ltr}

\fixme{Below are from slides bv may show at the Jan WS.  Content copied here and now as a starting point.}

The TPC data is used to generate \textit{trigger primitive messages}
(TPM) local to each APA and which summarize the activity recently
sensed by their connected conductors.  These TPMs are emited from each
APA DAQ Front End and become fodder for later determining
\textit{trigger command messages} (TCM) as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-daq-sel}.

Only the 480 collection channels associated with each APA face are
used for forming TCMs.  Reasons for this reduction include the fact
that collection channels:

\begin{itemize}
\item have higher signal to noise ratio compared to induction channels.
\item fully and independently are sensitive to each APA face.
\item have unipolar signals that directly give an approximate measure
  of ionization charge without costly field response deconvolution
  computation.
\item can be divided into smaller groups defined by natural hardware
  boundaries for parallel processing.
  % fixme: do we need a statement about efficiency here?
\end{itemize}


Figure~\ref{fig:daq-overview} illustrates the connectivity between the
four connectors on each of the five WIBs and the DAQ APA Front End.
The data is received from 80 1 Gbps fiber optical links by four
Reconfigurable Computing Elements (RCE) in the ACTA Cluster On Board
(COB) system. \fixme{Matt: help!  Each RCE consists of a ....}

The pattern of connectivity between WIBs and RCEs results in the data
from the collection channels covering one half of one APA face being
received by each RCE.  Each RCE has two primary functions.  The first
is transmission of all data as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-daq-hlt}.  The second is to produce TPMs from
its portion of the collection channel data.

The TPMs are produced from a \textit{trigger primitive production
  pipeline} of algorithms.  These algorithms still require development
but can be broadly described.   

\begin{enumerate}
\item On a per channel basis calculate a rolling baseline and RMS that
  characterizes recent samples minimal influence from ionization
  signal.
\item Locate contiguous ADC samples that go above a threshold which is
  defined in terms of the baseline and RMS.
\item Emit their time bounds and total charge as a $ROI_{ch}$ TPM.
\end{enumerate}

These $ROI_{ch}$ TPM represent some possible activity occurring
somewhere in the LAr within a $\pm$\SI{2.5}{\mm} strip that extends in
time by the ROI time bounds.  Depending on the threshold set, these
TPMs may be numerous due to \Ar39 decays and noise fluctuations.
Further processing must be done with more global information.  This
may be done as part of the Module Trigger Logic (MTL) as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-daq-sel} or it may be done immediately in the
RCE pipeline.  Strategies to summarize these detailed TPM into fewer
TPMs include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pad each $ROI_{ch}$ in a channel by a fixed amount in order to
  anticipate their use later as defining readout (eg, long enough to
  account for inter-plane drift times (\SI{6.25}{\micro\second}) and
  induction signal extents ($\sim$\SI{100}{\micro\second}).
\item Form the union of ROI across all channels observed by a given RCE.
\item Merge subsequent ROI which are separated by some small time
  interval.
\end{enumerate}

If the Single-Phase detector module generates excess noise, such as
that from RF emission picked up coherently across some group of
channel, it must be mitigated at the start of the pipeline and will
likely require additional computational resources.  Some ideas to
respond to this scenario include....\fixme{Ideas?}.

\label{sec:fdsp-daq-hlt}

\metainfo{Describe the dataflow {\it infrastructure}. This should cover transport of data and trigger information, infrastructure for generating local and global trigger commands (but not their algorithms, that's next), as well as what happens to the data once a trigger is generated (ie. event building).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Selection Algorithms (Josh Klein \& Brett Viren)}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-sel}

%This section describes the strategy for using the trigger/dataflow infrastructure, with example algorithms.

	Data Selection will follow a hierarchical design, beginning with local,
APA Level trigger candidates, Module (10 ktonne) Level triggers, and Global
(Detector-wide) triggers. A high-level trigger (HLT) may also be active within
the Module Level trigger.  The hierarchical approach is both natural from a
design standpoint, as well as allowing for vertical slice testing and
partitioning during commissioning of the system.

	As discussed above, trigger primitives will be generated in the RCEs
from the data stream for each collection wires.  The trigger primitives will be
summary information for each collection wire, such as the time of any
threshold-crossing pulse, its integral charge, and time over threshold.  A
collection wire with a non-null trigger primitive is said to be ``hit.''  These
trigger primitives are then passed, along with the full data stream, to the
FELIX boards and their hosts, each of which handles channels from a small
number of APAs (likely two).  An APA Level trigger candidate is passed upward to
a Module Level trigger, which arbirtrates between various trigger types,
determining whether a given APA Level trigger candidate is a valid Module
Trigger and whether there are other triggers that have a higher priority in any
given slice of time.  At this level, a more sophisticated high-level trigger
(HLT) may also be employed, which will allow a reduction in trigger rate from
various backrounds, including instrumental backgrounds, if needed. 

	A valid Module Level single-interaction trigger sends trigger commands
back to the FELIX hosts telling them which slice of time should be saved under
the particular trigger header.  At the start of DUNE data taking, it is
anticipated that for any given single-interaction trigger (a cosmic ray track,
for example) waveforms for all wires will be recorded for a full 5.4~ms
``readout window.'' Such an approach is clearly very conservative, but it
ensures that associated low-energy physics (such as neutron captures from
neutrons produced by neutrino interactions or cosmic rays) will be recorded
without any need to fine-tune APA-level triggering, and will not depend on
the noise environment across the APAs. In addition, the 5.4~ms readout window
ensures that regardless of when a given even causes a trigger, the entire track
is recorded.  We anticipate, however, that as we gain experience running DUNE
the overall data volume will reduced by writing out data from only a
subset of APAs for any given track, and possibly reducing the size of the
readout window.

	Other trigger streams---calibrations, random triggers, and prescales of
various trigger thresholds, will also be generated at the Module Level, and
filtering and compression can be applied based upon the trigger stream. For
example, a large fraction of random triggers may have their waveforms
zero-suppressed, reducing the data volume substantially, as the dominant data
source for these will be $^{39}$Ar events. Additional signal-processing can
also be done on particular trigger streams if needed and if the processing is
available, such as fast analyses of calibration data.

       At the Module Level, a decision can also be made on whether a series of
interactions are consistent with a supernova burst.  If the number of APA Level
low-energy trigger candidates exceeds a threshold for the number of such events
in a given time, a trigger command is sent from the Module Level back to the
RCEs, which store up to 10 seconds of unsuppressed, full waveform data.  That
full waveform is then written out as a separate trigger stream for fast
analysis by the supernova working group, perhaps as an automated process.  In
addition, the Module Level passes information about APA Level trigger
candidates  up to a detector-wide Global Trigger, which can decide whether,
integrated across all modules, enough APAs have detected interactions to
qualify for a supernova burst even if within a particular module the threshold
is not exceeded. Trigger commands from the Global Trigger Level are passed
downward to RCEs in the same way as any Module Level supernova burst trigger
would be; at the Module Level, a Global Trigger looks like just one more
``external'' trigger input.

	APA Level trigger candidates will be generated within each FELIX
host.  The trigger decision will be based on the number of adjacent wires hit
in a given APA within a narrow time window (roughly 100$\mu$s), the total
charge on these adjacent wires (or any wire with a non-null trigger primitive),
and possibly the time-over-threshold for collection wires with hits. Our
studies show that even for low-energy events (roughly 10-20 MeV) the reduction
in radiological backgrounds is extremely high with such criteria. The
highest-rate background, $^{39}$Ar, which has a decay rate of 10 MBq within a
10 ktonne volume of argon, has an endpoint of 500 keV and requires significant
pileup in both space and time to get near a 10 MeV threshold. Other important
background sources are $^{42}$Ar, which has a 3.5 MeV endpoint and a decay rate
of 1 kBq, and $^{222}$Rn which has a decay rate of XXXX and decays via a
highly-quenched $\alpha$ of 5.5 MeV.  The radon decays to $^{218}$Po which
a few minutes later leads to a quenched $\alpha$ of 6 MeV, and ultimately a
$^{214}$Bi daughter (many minutes later) which has a $\beta$ decay with
endpoint near 3.5 MeV.  The $\alpha$ ranges are short and will hit at most a
few collection wires, but the charge deposit can be large, and therefore the
charge threshold will have to be well above the $\alpha$ deposits plus any
pileup from $^{39}$Ar and noise.

	At the APA Level, two kinds of local trigger candidates can be
generated. One is a ``high-energy'' trigger, that indicates that within a given
APA a candidate event with energy more than 10 MeV has been found. The
thresholds in hit wires, total charge, and time-over-threshold, will be
optimized for at least 50\% efficiency at this threshold, with efficiency
increasing to 100\% via a turn-on curve that ensures at least 90\% efficiency
at 20 MeV.  A second APA Level trigger candiate will be generated for
low-energy events, between 5~MeV and 10 MeV. These low-energy APA trigger
candidates will not by themselves generate valid  Module Level triggers, but
rather be used at the Module Level to determine whether a burst of events
across many APAs is consistent with a supernova.

	The Module Level takes as input both APA Level trigger candidates (both
low-energy and high-energy), as well as external trigger candidate sources,
such as the Global (detector-wide) trigger, external triggers such as SNEWS,
and information about the time of a Fermilab Beam spill.  The Module Level will
also generate internal triggers, such as random triggers and calibration
triggers (for example, telling a laser system to fire at a prescribed time).
In addition, at the Module Level prescales of all trigger types that normally
would not generate a Module Level will be made. For example, a single
low-energy trigger does not cause a Module Level trigger on its own, but at
some large prescale fraction it could be accepted.



	The Module Level is responsible also for checking candidate triggers
against the current Run Control trigger mask: in some runs, for example, we
may decide that only random triggers are accepted, or that certain APA trigger
candidates should not be accepted because those APAs are noisy or misbehaving
in some way.  In addition, the Module Level will count low-energy trigger
candidates from the APAs and, based upon the number and distribution of those
triggers in a long time interval (e.g., 10 seconds), decide to generate a
supernova burst trigger command. The trigger logic for a supernova burst will
be optimized to accept at least 90\% of all Milky Way supernovae, and our
studies of simple low-energy trigger criteria show that we can likely do much
better than that.  

	The HLT can also be applied at this level, particularly if there are
unexpectedly higher rates from instrumental or low-energy backgrounds, that
require some level of reconstruction or pattern recognition.  An HLT might also
allow for efficency triggering on lower-energy single interactions, or allow
for better sensitivity for supernovae beyond the Milky Way, by employing a
weighting scheme to individual APA Level trigger candidates---higher-energy
trigger candidates receiving higher weights. Thus, for example, two APA Level
trigger candidates consistent with 10 MeV interactions in 10 seconds might be
enough to create a supernova burst candidate trigger, while 100 5 MeV APA Level
trigger candiates in 10 seconds might not. Lastly, the HLT can allow for
dynamic thresholding; for example, if a trigger appears to be a cosmic-ray
muon, the threshold for single interactions can be lowered (and possibly
prescaled) for a short time after that to identify spallation products. In
addition, the HLT could allow for a dynamic threshold after a supernova burst,
to extend sensitivity beyond the 10 s readout buffer, while not increasing the
data volume associated with supernova burst candidates linearly. 

All low-energy trigger candidates are also passed upwards to the Global trigger
level, which can integrate the APA level trigger across all 10 ktonne modules
and determine if enough APAs have trigger candidates that a supernova burst may
be occuring. This approach increases the sensitivity to trigger bursts by a
factor of four (for 40 ktonnes), thus extending the burst sensitivity to a
distance twice as far as for a single 10 ktonne module. 

	The Module Level is also responsible for creating a trigger header that
includes a global timestamp for the trigger, and information on what type of
trigger was created. A log of all APA Level trigger candidates will also be
kept, whether or not they are part of a Module Trigger.  A

s described above, for any high-energy APA Level trigger candidate, a Module
Level trigger command is sent  to all FELIX hosts instructing them to save a
5.4~ms readout window will written for all wires across all APAs 
(providing the start and end times to the FELIX hosts).  Thus, a DUNE ``event''
is 5.4~ms of data from all wires in response to a Module Level trigger.  The
Module Level trigger is also responsible for sending the trigger commands that
tell the RCEs to dump their 10 s unsuppressed ``supernova'' buffer.  If a
supernova burst trigger is created at the Global trigger level, a trigger
command is passed back down to the Module Level, which then passes that on to
the RCEs for readout of the long (10 s) unsuppressed buffer, the same way it
would if a supernova burst is detected at the Module Level.

\subsection{Timing \& Synchronization (David Cussans \& Kostas Manolopoulos)}
\label{sec:fdsp-daq-timing}

%Describe the generation of timing/synchronisation signals and and distribution to the detectors.

All components of the DUNE Single Phase detectors are synchronized to
a common clock. In order make full use of the information from the
photon detection system the common clock must be aligned within a
single detector with an accuracy of O(1ns). In order to form a common
trigger for super novae between detector modules the timing between
detectors must be aligned with an accuracy of O(1ms). However, a
tighter constraint is the need to calibrate the common clock to
universal time (derived from GPS) in order to adjust the data
selection algorithm inside an accelerator spill, which requires an
absolute accuracy of O(1us).

Single and Dual phase detector modules use a different timing system,
driven by the different technical requirements and development history
of the two systems. A single phase detector module has many more
timing end-points than a dual phase module and many of the end-points
are simpler than the end-points in the dual phase, for example a WIB
vs. uTCA crate. Both systems have been sucessfully prototyped.

The DUNE Single Phase detectors use a development of the protoDUNE
timing system. Synchronization messages are transmitted over a serial
data stream with the clock embedded in the data. The format is
described in DUNE DocDB-1651. Figure \ref{fig:daq-readout-timing}
shows the overall arrangement of components within the Single Phase
Timing System(SPTS). A stable master clock, disciplined with a 10MHz
reference is used in the SPTS. A one-pulse-per-second (1PPS) signal is
also received by the system and is time-stamped onto a counter clocked
by the SPTS master clock, however the periodic synchronization
messages distributed to the Single Phase detectors are an exact number
of clock cycles apart even if there is jitter in the 1PPS signal.

The GPS signal is encoded onto optical fibre and transmitted to the
CUC, where it is converted back to an RF signal on coaxial cable and
used as the input to a GPS displined oscillator. The oscillator module
also houses a IEEE 1588 (PTP) Grand Master and an NTP server. The PTP
Grand Master provides a timing signal for the Dual Phase White Rabbit
timing network. The NTP server provides an absolute time for the 1PPS
signal. The SPTS relates its time counter onto GPS time by
timestamping the 1PPS signal onto the SPTS time counter and reading
the time in software from the NTP server.

The latency from the GPS antenna on the surface to the GPS receiver in
the CUC will be measured by optical time domain reflectometry at
installation. Given the modest absolute time accuracy required
(sufficient to select data within an accelerator spill) dynamic
monitoring of this delay is not required.

The White Rabbit synchronization signals from the Dual Phase are
time-stamped onto the SPTS clock domain and the SPTS synchronization
signals are time stamped onto the Dual Phase clock domain. This allows
the timing in the Single Phase and Dual Phase detectors to be
aligned. A similar scheme is used to relate the Single Phase protoDUNE
Single Phase timing domain to be related to the beam instrumentation
White Rabbit time domain.

In order to provide redundancy, and also the ability to easily detect
issues with the timing path, two independent GPS systems are used. One
with an antenna at the head of the Yates shaft, the other with an
antenna at the head of the Ross shaft. The two independent timing
paths are brought together in the same rack in the CUC. Using 1:2
fibre splitters one SPTS unit can be left as a hot-spare while the
other is active. This also allows testing of new firmware and software
during comissioning without the risk of loosing the SPTS if a bug is
introduced.


\begin{dunefigure}[Arrangement of Components in DUNE Timing System]{fig:daq-readout-timing}
  {Illustration of the components in the DUNE Timing System.}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{DUNE_Timing_overall.pdf}
\end{dunefigure}

All the custom electronic components for the SPTS are contained in two
Micro-TCA shelves. At any one time one is active and the other is a
hot-spare. The 10MHz reference clock and the 1PPS signal are received
by a single width AMC at the centre of the Micro-TCA shelf. This
master timing AMC produces the SPTS signals and encodes them onto a
serial data stream. This serial datastream is distributed over a
standard star-point backplane to the fanout AMCs which each drive the
signal onto up to 13 SFP cages. The SFP cages are either occupied by
1000Base-BX SFPs, each of which connects to a fibre running to an APA,
or to a Direct Attach cable which connects to systems elsewhere in the
CUC, i.e. the RCE crates and the data selection system. This
arrangement is shown in figure \ref{fig:daq-readout-sp-timing}
