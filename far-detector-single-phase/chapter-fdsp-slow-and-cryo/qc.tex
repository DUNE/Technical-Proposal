\subsection{Purity Monitors}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc-pm}

The purity monitor system will undergo a series of tests to ensure the performance of the system.  This will start with the individual purity monitors being tested in vacuum after each one is fabricated and assembled.  This test will look at the amplitude of the signal generated by the drift electrons at the cathode and the anode.  This will ensure that the photocathode is able to provide a sufficient number of photoelectrons for the measurement to be made with the required precision, and that the field gradin resistors are all working properly to maintain the drift field and hence transport the drift electrons to the anode.  A follow-up test in LAr would then be performed for each of the individual purity monitors, ensuring that the performance expected in LAr is met.  The next step after individual testing would be to assemble the entire system and make checks of the connections along the way.  Ensuring that the connections are all proper during this time will reduce the risk of having issues once the system is finally assembled and ready for the final test.  With the full system assembled it would be placed into the shipping tube, which can also serve as a vacuum chamber, and a test made with the system in vacuum.  This would ensure that the performance seen during the individual purity monitors tests can still be achieved after making the final assembly.  If there is a LAr test facility with the height or length required for the full purity monitor system and it is available for use, then a final full system test would be made there ensuring that the full system operates in LAr and achieves the required performance.

\subsection{Gas Analyzers}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc-ga}

The Gas Analizers should have the Warranty of the manufacturer (vienen calibrados?). However, once received, the Gas Analyzer modules will be checked for both “zero” and the “span” values using a precision gas-mixing instrument. This is done by using two gas cylinders with both a zero level of the Gas Analyzer contaminant species (for the zero level) and a cylinder with a known percentage of the contaminant gas. This should verify the proper operation of the Gas Analyzers. When eventually installed in DUNE, this process will be repeated. It is also important to repeat the calibrations at the manufacturer recommended periods over the gas analyzer lifetime.

\subsection{Light emitting system}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc-les}

The complete system will be checked before installation to ensure the light emission. 
Initial testing of the light emitting system (see Fig in light
emission section) can be done by first
measuring the current when a low voltage (1V) is applied, to check
that the resistive LED failover path is correct. Next, measurement
of the forward voltage with the nominal forward current applied, to
check that it is within 10\%\ of the nominal forward voltage drop of
the LEDs, that all of the LEDs are illuminated, and that each of the
LEDs is visible over the nominal angular range. If the LEDs are
infrared, a video camera with IR filter removed will be used for the
visual check. This procedure is then duplicated with the current
reversed for the LEDs oriented in the opposite direction.  

These tests will be duplicated during
installation to make sure that the system has
not been damaged in transportation or installation. However, once
the LEDs are in the cryostate the visual check will be harder.


\subsection{Slow Controls Hardware}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-qc-sc-hard}

Networking and computing systems will be commercially bought requiring a quality assurance (QA). However, the new servers will be tested after delivery to confirm no damage during shipping. The new system will be let "burn in" overnight or for a few days, running a diagnostics suite on a loop. This should turn up anything that escaped the manufacturers QA.

The system can be shipped directly to underground, where an onsite expert can do the initial booting of systems and basic configuration, then the specfic
config info is pulled over the network and people ssh in remotely to do
the final setup, minimizing the number of people underground.
