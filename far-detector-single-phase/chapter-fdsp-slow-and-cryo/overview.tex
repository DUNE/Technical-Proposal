The purpuse of the cryogenics instrumentation devices is to guaranty a high LAr purity, which is essential for the detector performance.  
It has been demonstrated in a small LAr-TPC prototype at Fermilab (the 35-ton prototype) that vertical temperature gradients
as low as 0.02 K may result in the liquid argon being stratified, with colder argon staying at the bottom of the cryostat and not mixing
with the LAr above it. The lack of proper LAr recirculation causes, in turn, an accumulation of impurities that
can severely affect the detector performance through a reduced electron lifetime. The design of the DUNE cryogenics
system is such that the LAr stratification problem
is in principle solved, as LAr will be injected at the bottom of the cryostat with a slightly higher temperature than the bulk LAr,
favouring LAr recirculation. Nevertheless, this concept needs to be demonstrated in the real detector. 
%For this purpose, a set of high precision temperature sensors will be installed at different heights within the cryostat,
%together with three purity monitors to measure the electron lifetime.
