The installation of cryogenics instrumentation devices will be done in several phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Before detector installation: Individual temperature sensors anchored to the cryogenic pipes at the bottom of the cryostat and static T-gradient monitors
  will be installed right after the installation of the pipes. Additional level meters could be also installed during this phase. 
\item During detector installation: Temperature sensors anchored to the top ground planes will be installed in several steps
\item After detector installation: dynamic T-gradient monitors and purity monitors will be installed once the detector in installed. 
\end{enumerate}


%Integration: Initial integration between the two systems will be accomplished at vertical slice and DAQ test stands:
%test of cameras for the detection of sparks, testing SC monitoring/control of HV PS, testing HV interlock status bits, etc.
%Integration/installation of CISC devices (cameras, RTDs) on ground planes will be tested at system integration/assembly sites. Final integration will take place as the two systems are commissioned.

\subsection{Commissioning}
\label{sec:fdsp-slow-cryo-install-commiss}

Some parts of the CISC system will be commissioned prior to HV commissioning, and before cryostat filling with LAr.
This is the case for RTDs on GPs, cold and inspection cameras and thermal interlocks for PS. Final commissioning of
those systems will be done once the cryostat is filled, since operation will be different in the presence of LAr.
Commissioning the control/monitoring of HV PS and any related hardware interlocks could probably be done at an early
stage as well, provided no real HV is provided to the cathode/field-cages. Final commissioning will be done once HV is
switched on. This will also require coordination from other groups such as LBNF, DAQ, APA etc. The commissioning of the
interfacing elements should follow naturally after (successful) integration testing.
