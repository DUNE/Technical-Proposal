\chapter{Technical Coordination}
\label{ch:fdsp-coord}

Construction of the DUNE Detector is a complex activity. While the
technology for massive noble liquid detectors has developed over the
last 45 years, the first large liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber
(LArTPC) was completed in 2010. While multiple LArTPCs have operated
worldwide, the technology is still relatively new and the scale up to
DUNE is significant. The technology is well suited to massive neutrino
detectors with millimeter scale resolution on 100m scale detectors.

DUNE consists of a large number of institutions distributed throughout
the world. They are supported by a large number of funding sources and
collaborate with a large number of commercial partners. DUNE has
empowered several Consortia (currently nine) with the responsibility
to secure funding for, design, fabricate, assemble, install,
commission and operate the key components of the DUNE far detector.

DUNE Technical Coordination, under the direction of the DUNE Technical
Coordinator, has responsibility to monitor the technical aspects of
the detector construction of the detector subsystems, to integrate the
detector and for a number of common projects. Groups of institutes
within DUNE form Consortia that take complete responsibility for
construction of their system.

Given the horizontal nature of the Consortia structure and the
extensive interdependencies between the systems, a significant
engineering organization is required to deliver DUNE on schedule and
within specifications and funding constraints.

The DUNE Technical Coordinator reports to the DUNE Spokespersons and the
FNAL Director. The responsibilities ot Technical Coordination include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item management and delivery of all common projects
  \item review of all aspects of the project
  \item configuration control of all interface drawings and envelopes
  \item project schedule and milestones
  \item project work, product and assembly breakdown schedules
  \item project risk register
  \item DUNE engineering and safety standards, including grounding \& shielding
  \item monitoring of all consortia
  \item installation of the detectors at the near and far sites
  \item logistics for detector integration and installation at the near and far sites
  \item quality assurance and all QA related studies and documents
  \item ES\&H organization and all saftey related studies and documents
  \item recording of all project engineering information, including: documents, drawings and models
\end {itemize}

DUNE TC is organized in the following way... DUNE TC interacts with
