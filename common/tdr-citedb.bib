We plan to use the utphys.bst style for compilation. 
                  
CONVENTIONS:

5235, Please follow these (Instructions and reference info goes to about line 80 
in this file; please read through it before adding citations!

 - When adding citations to this file, if possible, copy the BibTeX rendering 
 of the citation from http://inspirehep.net. 

 - Many citations already exist in the file citedb.bib, also under the "common" 
 directory. It has entries from the CDR, the protoDUNE-SP TDR and possibly other
 documents. You can search it to see if the citation you want is there.

 - List DocDB notes like:

@BOOK{strunk,
   author = {Strunk, Jr., William and E. B. White},
   title = "{The Elements of Style}",
   publisher = {Macmillan},
   edition = {Third},
   year = 1979
   }

@techreport{tdr-vol-1,
title = "{TDR Volume 1: The LBNF and DUNE Projects}",
collaboration = {{DUNE}},
year = {2018},
note = "\url{http://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=nnnn}"
}

To make anything literal, surround it in {}'s.

A note on comments:  
 - EVERYTHING outside of an "at" block is a comment.
 - You can comment out an "at" block by deleting the "at" character.
 - Do not put any type of comments inside an "at" block. They are not allowed.

The order of citations in this file does not matter.                  
                  
A note on authors:

 - Spell out the full names and separate them with  the word "and".  If the 
 author list is too long to write everyone then end it with "and others" -- 
 NOT "et al".  The style will take care of things like only showing first initial 
 and changing "and others" to "et al".  

For help with bibtex see:

 - http://nwalsh.com/tex/texhelp/bibtx-23.html (This is about rendering names)

A few examples follow.
