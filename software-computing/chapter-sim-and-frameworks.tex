\subsection{Fast Monte Carlo}

A Fast Monte Carlo (FMC) program was developed by the LBNE collaboration and was used to
compute oscillation sensitivities~\cite{cdr-vol-2}.  The FMC simulated neutrino interactions
on argon using the LBNF flux spectrum and the GENIE~\cite{GENIE} generator.  The detector
responses to the final-state particles produced by GENIE are approximated with efficiency
fractions as functions of particle energy, energy resolution smearing fractions, and
correct and incorrect particle identification rates.  The events were divided into
$\nu_\mu$CC-like, $\nu_e$-CC-like, and NC-like, for the near and far detectors, and the
inputs provided to a parameter fit, such as CAFANA, GLoBES, or LOAF.  The details of the
detector response and analysis requirements can be found in~\cite{cdr-vol-2}.  The CPU time needed
for the FMC project is 1 to 4~M hours per year, with $<1$~TB of storage required, when
it is fully used.  The emphasis on full simulation and reconstruction results however has
displaced the FMC in 2016 and 2017.

\subsection{Geant4 and Detector Response Modeling}

Interactions of particles with the detector materials, both active and inactive, is simulated with 
GEANT4~\cite{GEANT4:NIM}\cit{GEANT4}.  GEANT4 is also used as the underlying physics model for G4LBNF, the
simulation of the baffle, target, horns, and decay pipe.  GEANT4 simulates particle trajectories in steps,
taking into account electric and magnetic fields, as well as interaction and scattering probabilities in the
matter at each step.  GEANT4 requires a detailed description of the geometry of the materials through which
it simulates particle propagation.

LArSoft~\cite{larsoft} provides an interface to GEANT4 that is optimized for liquid argon time projection
chambers.  Step sizes are limited by voxelizing the active liquid argon volume into cubes 300~$\mu$m on a side.
Ionization and scintillation are modeled with a modified Box function~\cite{box} or with NEST~\cite{nest}, using
the energy deposition on each step provided by GEANT4.  Ionization and delta rays are part of a continuous
spectrum -- GEANT4 tracks delta rays down to an energy of ??~KeV using the default LArSoft paramaterization.
The GEANT4 step of a LArSoft simulation typically runs as a separate job, and the output of this job is the
number of electrons deposited on each wire after LArSoft's custom drift and diffusion simulation, which
takes into account recombination, electron lifetime, space charge, and detector geometry effects.  The charge
is summed over all contributing particle steps and integrated over diffusion, and reported separately for
each particle for each tick on each wire (a particle may have many small GEANT4 steps which contribute
charge to a wire).  The average position of the charge creation points are recorded for each particle for each
tick on each wire as well.  

In the LArSoft interface,  it is possible to specify a magnetic field that will cause charged-particle
trajectories to deflect.

The GEANT4 step, along with the LArSoft-supplied drift modeling, is the second-quickest simulation step,
after the generation stage, with ??~sec/event for far detector neutrino interactions, and ??~sec/event for
ProtoDUNE events with cosmic rays.  GEANT4 however requires several GB of auxiliary data files in order
to parameterize the interactions of particles with matter.  The GEANT4 collaboration actively compares
the modeling of published data distributions and tunes the simulation to improve the modeling.

\section{FLUKA}

FLUKA~\cite{FLUKA} is a full-featured physics and detector simulation package.  It is capable of
performing the same role as GEANT4 in the beam simulations, as well as in the detector response modeling.
FLUKA also has the ability to model neutrino-nucleus interactions, and thus can substitute for GENIE.
Due to the prohibitive computational load of simulating all of the drifting electrons and propagating
photons, the same solution of a custom LArSoft-based drift and charge deposit model would still be needed
if FLUKA were to take on all other roles.  A project has started to interface FLUKA at several points upstream
of the detector charge deposit modeling.  Comparing FLUKA-based calculations with those based on GEANT4 and
GENIE provides additional abilities to model external data and detector data properly, and to estimate
systematic uncertainties.

\section{Electronics and DAQ Emulation}

The output of the GEANT4 step, which consists of simulated charge deposits on each wire, requires
additional processing to model the expected signals to be digitized.  The digitizers measure the
current on each wire integrated over the sampling time, chosen to be 2~$\mu$s.  As charge drifts
by an induction-plane wire, it induces a current that is a bipolar function of time, while the
current in a collection-plane wire is a unipolar function of time.  The differences in the arrival
times of charge drifting past the layers due to the finite spacing between the layers are include.
LArSoft parameterizes the response
of the detector as a Green's function -- the response of a packet of charge localized in space and time,
and this funtion is convoluted with the function describing the arrival times of the charges passing by
or collecting on the wires.  This convolution is performed in frequency space after FFT'ing the charge
arrival function.  At this stage, the electronics response transfer function is multiplied in.  An inverse
FFT predicts the time-domain signal.  The signal gain is a separately controllable parameter in LArSoft.
  Noise is then added, either white noise or an exponentially falling
spectrum, and then the result is discretized and truncated to the expected range of the 12-bit ADCs.  

Additional steps, such as modeling of stuck bits or groups of bits are configurable within LArSoft.
Modeling dead channels or groups of channels is frequently performed as an early step
in the reconstruction job so that Monte Carlo samples can be reused with varying fractions and placement
of dead channels.

The output of the electronics simulation is digitized waveforms.  Zero suppression is optionally
applied.  The simulated data are compressed either with ROOT's built-in compression, or a fixed-dictionary
Huffman algorithm.
