The cryogenics test facility is intended to provide the access to a small ($<$ \num{1} ton) to intermediate ($\sim$ \num{4} tons) volumes of purified TPC-grade \lar{}. Hardware that needs liquid of purity this high include any device intending to drift electrons for millisecond time periods. Not all devices require purity this high, but may need a relatively large volume to provide the needed prototyping environment. Of importance is a relatively fast turn-around time of approximately a week for short prototyping runs.

Figure~\ref{fig:CryTest-Blanche} shows the Blanche test stand cryostat at \fnal.
