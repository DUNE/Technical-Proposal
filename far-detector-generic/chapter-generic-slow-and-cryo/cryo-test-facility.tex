The Cryogenics Test Facility is intended to provide the access to a small ($<$ \num{1} ton) to intermediate ($\sim$ \num{4} tons) volumes of purified ``TPC-grade'' LAr. Hardware that needs this high purity liquid include any device intending to drift electrons for millisecond time periods. Not all devices need this high purity, but may need a relatively large volume to provide the needed prototyping environment. Of importance is a relatively fast turn-around time of approximately a week for short prototyping runs.

Fig.~\ref{fig:CryTest-Blanche} shows the Blanche Test Stand Cryostat at Fermilab.
