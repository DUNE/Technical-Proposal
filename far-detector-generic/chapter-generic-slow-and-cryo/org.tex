\subsection{Slow Controls and Cryogenics Instrumentation Consortium Organization}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-org-consortium}

% same in sp and dp

The organization of the \dword{cisc} consortium is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-cryo-org}. The \dword{cisc} consortium board is
currently formed from institutional representatives from \num{17} institutes
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:gen-slow-cryo-org}. The consortium leader
acts as the spokesperson for the consortium and is responsible for the
overall scientific program and management of the group. The technical
leader of the consortium is responsible for the project management for
the group.  Currently five working groups are envisioned in the
consortium (leaders to be appointed):


%Cryogenics systems gas analyzers, liquid level monitors and cryogenic internal piping; CFD simulations

%\lar instrumentation purity monitors, thermometers, cameras and light emitting system, and instrumentation test facility; feedthroughs; \efield simulations; Instrumentation precision studies; \dword{protodune} data analysis coordination efforts

Additionally, since the \dword{cisc} consortium broadly interfaces with other
groups, liaisons have been identified for various roles as listed in
Figure~\ref{fig:gen-slow-cryo-org}. A short-term focus group was
recently formed to understand the needs for cryogenics modeling for the
consortium.  Currently members from new
institutes are added to the consortium based on consensus from the
consortium board members.

\subsection{Planning Assumptions}
\label{sec:fdgen-slow-cryo-org-assmp}

The slow controls and cryogenic instrumentation is a joint effort for \single and \dual{}.
A single slow controls system will be implemented to serve both \single and \dual{}.

Design and installation of cryogenics systems (gas analyzers, liquid level monitoring, internal piping) is coordinated with LBNF, with the consortium providing resources, and effort and expertise provided by LBNF.
\dword{protodune} designs for \lar instrumentation (purity monitors, thermometers, cameras, test facility) provide the basis for DUNE designs. Design validation, testing, calibration, and performance will be evaluated through \dword{protodune} data.

% The editors at meeting of 2/13 suggest that the WBS section should be deleted in the TP. Accordingly, I have commented it out.

% The editors at meeting of 2/13 suggest that the TP need not have costing. Accordingly, I have renamed this section ``High-level Schedule''.
