\subsection{Detector Support System}

The \dword{dss} provides the structural support for the single-phase
detector inside the cryostat.  It also provides the necessary
infrastructure to move the detector elements into location during
assembly. As the \dword{dss} is a new design and is quite different
from the ProtoDUNE \dword{dss} it is described in some detail in this
section. The detector elements supported by the \dword{dss} include
the field cage endwalls, the \dwords{apa}, and the \dwords{cpa} with
top and bottom field cage panels.  The \dword{dss} is supported by the
cryostat outer steel structure through a series of feedthroughs which
cross through the cryostat insulation and are anchored with flanges on
the cryostat roof. Inside the cryostat a series of stainless steel
I-beams are connected to the feedthroughs and used to support the
detector. The \dword{dss} defines the location of the detector inside
the cryostat and it also defines how the detector elements
move/contract as the detector is brought to \dword{lar}
temperature. The design of the \dword{dss} encompasses the overall
structural design of the detector as only after the elements are
mounted to the \dword{dss} and are connected together do they make a
unified mechanical structure. The requirements of the \dword{dss} are
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \setlength\itemsep{1mm}
\setlength{\parsep}{1mm}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-5mm}
% \small
\item Support the weight of the detector.
\item Accommodate cryosat roof movement during filling, testing, and operation.
\item Accommodate variation in feedthrough locations and
  variation in the flange angles due to installation tolerances and
  loading on the warm structure.
\item Accommodate shrinkage of the detector and \dword{dss} from ambient
  temperature to \dword{lar} temperature.
\item Define the position of the detector components relative to each other. 
\item Provide electrical connection to the cryostat ground and remain electrically isolated from the detector.
\item Support penetrations must be purged with GAr to prevent contaminants from diffusing back into the liquid
\item The instrumentation cabling must not interfere with the \dword{dss}.
\item Components must be installed through the \dword{tco}
\item Design to meet AISC-360 or appropriate codes required at SURF
\item Design to meet seismic requirements 1 mile underground at SURF
\item All materials must be compatible for operation in ultrapure \dword{lar}
\item Beams will be completely submerged in \dword{lar}
\item Ensure that detector components shall not be less than \SI{400}{mm} from the membrane flat surface
\item Supports shall not interfere with the cryostat I-beam structures
\item Design such that the detector lower ground plane is above the cryogenic piping and the top of the \dword{dss} beams are submerged in \dword{lar} while leaving a 4\% ullage at the top of the cryostat.
\item Infrastructure necessary to move the \dword{apa} and
  \dword{cpa}-FC assemblies from outside the cryostat through the
  \dword{tco} and to the correct position.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:DSS} (left) shows the \dword{dss} structure; there are
five rows of supports for the alternating rows of
\dword{apa}-\dword{cpa}-\dword{apa}-\dword{cpa}-\dword{apa}.  The
\dword{dss} is connected to the warm structure at a flange that is
mounted on the outside of the cryostat.  Figure~\ref{fig:DSS} (right)
shows the layout of these structural feedthroughs.  The \dword{dss}
consists of pairs of feedthroughs that support \SI{6.4}{m}-long
S8x18.4 stainless steel I-beam sections. The proposed design of the
\dword{dss} has \num{10} I-beam segments per row for a total of
\num{50} I-beam segments. Each I-beam is suspended on both ends by
rods from feedthroughs that penetrate the roof.  In the cold condition
each beam will shrink which will cause gaps to form between
\dwords{apa} that are adjacent but supported on separate beams.
\dwords{apa} that are supported on the same beam will not have gaps
develop because both the beam and \dwords{apa} are stainless steel so
they will shrink together.  Each beam is supported by a nearly
\SI{2}{m} long rod that allows the beam support to move as the beam
contracts.
%\fixme{too much detail}
%The feedthrough consists of a flange and $8 ^{''}$ OD structural tube
%welded to it that extends through the cryostat insulation.  There is a
%nominal \SI{10}{mm} gap between the OD of the tube and the ID of the
%clearance tube in the cryostat.  The purpose of the $8 ^{''}$ tube is
%to provide lateral support to the I-beams during installation.
%Running down the center of the feedthrough is a $1^{"}$ diameter rod that
%is supported at a swivel washer at the flange and then supports the
%I-beam at a clevis.  The gas seal is obtained by Conflat Flange and a
%bellows that seals around the swivel washer.  The lateral position of
%the rod can be adjusted to adjust the height of the \dword{dss} I-beams.

Detector components will be installed using a shuttle beam system
illustrated in Fig.~\ref{shuttle}.  The last two columns of
feedthroughs (eastern most) will support temporary beams that run
north-south, perpendicular to the main \dword{dss} beams.  A shuttle
beam
%shown in orange
will have trolleys mounted to it and will transverse
north-south until aligned with the required row of \dword{dss} beam.  The last
\dword{apa} or \dword{cpa} in a row is supported by the shuttle beam which is bolted
directly to the feedthroughs once it is in place.  As the last \dword{cpa} or
\dword{apa} in each row is installed the north-south beams are removed.

There will be a mechanical interlock system that prevents trolleys
from passing the end of the shuttle beam unless it is aligned with a
corresponding \dword{dss} beam.  The shuttle beam and each detector will be
moved using a motorized trolley.  A commercially available motorized
trolley will be modified as needed to meet the needs of the
installation.

The \dword{dss} installation begins with the placement and alignment of all
the feedthroughs onto the flanges that are mounted to the warm vessel.
There are \num{25} feedthroughs per row and five rows for a total of \num{125}
feedthroughs.  A fixture with a tooling ball will be attached to the
clevis of each feedthrough.  The $XY$ position in the horizontal plane
and the vertical $Z$ position of this tooling ball will be defined.  A
survey will be performed to determine the location of each tooling
ball center and $XY$ and $Z$ adjustments will be made to get the tooling
ball centers to within $\pm$\SI{3}{mm}.  The \SI{6.4}{m} long I-beams will then be
raised and pinned to the clevis.  Each beam weighs roughly 350~lbs.
A lifting tripod will be placed over each of the feedthroughs
supporting a beam and a $1/4 ^{''}$ cable will be fed through the top
flange of the feedthrough down the \SI{14}{m} to the cryostat floor where it
will be attached to the I-beam.  The winches on each tripod will raise
the beam in unison in order to get it to the correct height to be
pinned to the feedthrough clevis.  Once the beams are mounted a final
survey of the beams will occur to ensure they are located and aligned
to each other properly.

A mock up of the shuttle system will be constructed to test the
mechanical interlock and drive systems for the shuttle beam
for each detector.  Tests will be conducted to evaluate the level of
misalignment between beams that can be tolerated and the amount of
positional control that can be achieved with the motorized trolley. It
is expected this will be finished prior to the TDR. At the time of the
TDR a larger prototype installation at Ash River will be under
construction. This prototype will use full scale elements and will be
used to develop the installation procedures and to also test the
detector installation process.
