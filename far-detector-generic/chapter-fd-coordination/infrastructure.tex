\section{Detector Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-infrastructure}

\dword{tc} is responsible for delivering the common infrastructure for
the \dword{fd}. This infrastructure is typically equipment that is used
by many groups. This may include: the electronics racks on top of the
cryostat with power, cooling, networking and safety systems, cable
trays, cryostat crossing tubes, and flanges, detector safety systems
and ground monitoring and isolation transformers.

\dword{tc} is responsible for the systems to support the
detectors. For the \dword{dpmod} this may consist of a cable
winch system similar to \dword{pddp}.  In the case of the
\dword{spmod} the installation group also provides the
\dword{dss}, which supports the detector and is needed to bring
equipment into the correct location in the cryostat.
