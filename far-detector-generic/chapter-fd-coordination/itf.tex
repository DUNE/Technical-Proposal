\section{Integration \& Test Facility (ITF)}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-test}

\dword{dune} TC is responsible for interfacing with the \dword{lbnf} 
logistics team at Sanford Lab to coordinate transport of all detector
components into the underground areas.  Due to the limited availability 
of surface areas at the lab for component storage, nearby facilities 
will be required to receive, store and ship materials to the Ross Shaft 
on an as-needed basis. A team within the TC organization will be needed 
to develop and execute the plan for receiving detector components at a 
surface facility and transporting them to the Ross shaft in coordination 
with the on-site \dword{lbnf} logistics team.  The surface facility will 
require wharehouse space with an associated inventory system, storage 
facilities, material transport equipment and access to trucking.  Basic 
functions of this facility will be to receive the detector components 
arriving from different production sites around the world and prepare 
them for transport into the underground areas, incorporating re-packaging 
and testing as necessary. As a substantial facility will necessarily be 
required, it can also serve as a location where some detector components 
are integrated and undergo further testing prior to installation.  

The logistics associated with integrating and installing the
\dword{dune} Far Detectors and their associated infrastructure present
a number of challenges. Possible difficulties include the size and
complexity of the detector itself, the number of sites around the
world that will be fabricating detector and infrastructure components,
the necessity for protecting components from dust, vibration and shock
during their journey to the deep underground laboratory and the lack
of space on the surface near the Sanford Lab Ross Shaft. To help
mitigate the associated risks, \dword{dune} plans to establish an
\dword{itf} somewhere in the vicinity of Sanford Lab. This facility
and its associated staff will need to provide certain functions and
services connected to the \dword{dune} far detector integration and
installation effort and has other potential roles that are still under
consideration.  The areas to which the \dword{itf} will and could
contribute are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Transport Buffer:} The \dword{itf} needs to provide
    storage capacity for a minimum one month buffer of detector
    components required for the detector installation process in the
    vicinity of Sanford Lab and be able to accept packaging materials
    returned from the underground laboratory.
  \item {\bf Longer-term Storage:} The \dword{itf} needs to provide
    longer-term storage of detector components that need to be
    produced in advance of when they are to be installed and for which
    sufficient storage space does not exist at the production sites.
  \item {\bf Re-packaging} The \dword{itf} needs to have the ability
    to re-package components arriving from the various production
    sites into boxes that can be safely transported through the shaft
    into the underground areas.
  \item {\bf Component Fabrication:} The fabrication of some
    components could be best suited to being located in the vicinity
    of the Sanford Lab at the \dword{itf}, taking advantage of
    undergraduate science and engineering students from the South
    Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM\&T).
  \item {\bf Component Integration:} Detector components received from 
    different production sites that need to be integrated prior to being 
    delivered to the underground area such as the installation of photon 
    detectors and electronics on the Anode Plane Assemblies could be done
    prior to re-packaging at the \dword{itf}.    
  \item {\bf Inspection, Testing and Repair:} In cases where
    components are re-packaged for transport to the undergound area,
    \dword{itf} support for performing tests on these components to
    ensure that no damage has occured during shipping is likely
    desirable.  In addition, components integrated at the \dword{itf}
    would require additional testing prior to being re-packaged.  The
    \dword{itf} could provide facilities needed to repair some of the
    damaged components (others would likely need to be returned to
    their production sites).
  \item {\bf Collaborator Support:} The host institution of the \dword{itf}
    will need to be able to provide support for a significant number
    of \dword{dune} collaborators involved in the above activities
    including services such as housing assistance, office space,
    computing access, and safety trainings.
  \item {\bf Outreach:} The host institution of the \dword{itf} would be
    ideally situated for supporting an outreach program to build upon
    the considerable public interest in the experiment that exists
    within South Dakota to create long-term public support for
    \dword{dune} specifically and particle physics more generally.
\end{itemize}

The cryostats that will house the far detectors and the cryogenic
systems that support them will be provided by the facilities project
(\dword{lbnf}).  Additional, large surface facilities in the vicinity
of SURF will be required to stage the components of these
infrastructure peices prior to their installation in the underground
areas.  The requirements for these facilities, in contrast to the
\dword{itf}, are relatively straight-forward and can likely be met by
a commercial warehousing vendor, who would provide suitable storage
space, loading and unloading facilities, and a commercial inventory
management and control system.  It is currently envisioned that
operation of the \dword{lbnf} surface facilities and the \dword{dune}
\dword{itf} will be independent from one another.  However, the
inventory systems used at the different facilities will need to be
interconnected with each other to ensure proper coordination of all
deliveries being made to the Sanford Lab site.

A reasonable criterion for the locations of these surface staging
facilities is to be within roughly an hour drive of Sanford Lab.
Population centers in South Dakota within this radius are Lead,
Deadwood, Sturgis, Spearfish, and Rapid City.  The \dword{lbnf}
surface facilities, which are not expected to have significant
auxilliary functionality, would logically be located as near to the
Sanford Lab site as possible.  In the case of the \dword{dune}
\dword{itf}, however, locating the facility in Rapid City to take
advantage of facilities and resources associated with the South Dakota
School of Mines \& Technologies (SDSM\&T) has a number of poetential
advantages.  SDSM\&T and the local business community in Rapid City
have expressed interest in incorporating the \dword{dune} \dword{itf}
into an overall regional development program.

\subsection{Requirements}

The leadership teams associated with the \dword{dune} institutional
consortia taking responsibility for the different far detector
subsystems have provided input to TC on which potential \dword{itf}
functions and services would be applicable to their subsystems.  The
consortia have also made preliminary assessments of the facility
infrastructure requirements that would be necessary in order for these
functions and services to be provided for their subsystems at the
\dword{itf}.  An attempt to capture preliminary, global requirements
for the \dword{itf} based on the information received from the
consortia results in the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Warehousing space on the order of 30,000 sq. feet driven by
    potential need to store hundreds of the larger detector components
    needed to construct the TPCs.  The provided space will need to
    maintain some minimal cleanliness requirements (e.g. no insects)
    and be climate-controlled within reasonable temperature and
    humidity ranges.
  \item Crane and/or forklift coverage throughout the wharehousing
    space to access components as needed for further processing and/or
    transport to the Sanford Lab.
  \item Docking area to load trucks with detector components being
    transported to the Sanford Lab and receive packaging materials
    returned from the site.
  \item Smaller clean room areas within the wharehousing space to
    allow for the re-packaging of detector components for transport
    into the underground areas.  Re-packaging of larger components
    will require local crane coverage within the approriate clean room
    spaces.
  \item Dedicated space for racks and cabinets available for dry-air
    storage and testing of electronics components.  Racks and cabinets
    should be properly connected to the building ground to avoid
    potential damage from electrostatic discharges.
  \item Climate-controlled dark room space for the handling and
    testing photon detector components.
  \item Dedicated clean room on order of 10,000 sq. feet to facilitate
    integration of electronics and photon detectors on Anode Plane
    assemblies (APAs), which make up the readout planes of the
    single-phase far detector. The integrated APAs are tested in Cold
    Boxes supported by cryogenics infrastructure.  Clean room lighting
    must be UV-filtered to avoid damaging the photon detectors.
    Height of the clean room must accomodate crane coverage needed for
    movement of the APAs in and out of the Cold Boxes.  It will also
    be necessary to have platforms for installation crews to perform
    work at heights within different locations in the clean room.
  \item Access to machine and electronics shops for making simple
    repairs and fabricating un-anticpated tooling.
  \item Access to shared office space for up to 30 collaborators
    contributing to the activities taking place at the \dword{itf}.
    Assistance for identifying temporary housing in the vicinity of
    the \dword{itf} for the visiting collaborators.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Management}

Overall management of the \dword{itf} is envisioned to be
reponsibility of one or more of the collaborating institutions on
\dword{dune}.  If the \dword{itf} is located in Rapid City, SDSM\&T
would be a natural choice due to its physical proximity, connections
to the local community and ability to provide access to resources and
facilities that would benefit planned \dword{itf} activities.  Intial
discussions with SDSM\&T representatives have taken place, in which
they have expressed a clear interest for hosting the \dword{itf}.
Additional discussions will be needed to understand the details of the
\dword{itf} management structure with in the context of a more
finalized set of requirements for the facility.

\subsubsection{Inventory System}

Effective inventory management will be essential for all aspects of
\dword{dune} detector development, construction, installation and
operation.  While its relevance and importance go beyond the
Integration and Test Facility, the \dword{itf} is the location at
which \dword{lbnf}, \dword{dune} project management, consortia
scientific personnel and SURF operations will interface.  We therefore
will develop standards and protocols for inventory management as part
of the \dword{itf} planning.  A critical requirement for the project
is that the inventory management system for procurement, construction
and installation must be compatible with future QA, calibration and
detector performance database systems.  Experience with past large
detector projects, notably NOvA, has demonstrated that the capability
to track component-specific information is extremely valuable
throughout installation, testing, commissioning and routine operation.
Compatibility between separate inventory management and physics
information systems will be maintained for effective operation and
analysis of \dword{dune} data.
