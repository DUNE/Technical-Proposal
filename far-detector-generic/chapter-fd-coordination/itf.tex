\subsection{Surface Logistics \& Testing}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-test}

The logistics for integrating and installing the DUNE Far Detectors
and their associated infrastructure face a number of
challenges. Possible difficulties include the size and complexity of
the detector itself, the number of sites around the world that will be
fabricating detector and infrastructure components, the necessity for
protecting components from dust, vibration and shock during their
journey to the deep underground laboratory and the lack of space on
the surface near the Sanford Lab Ross Shaft. One mitigation
of these risks is the establishment of a DUNE
Integration and Test Facility (ITF) somewhere in the vicinity of
Sanford Lab. Such a facility and its associated staff would contribute
to DUNE in the following areas.
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Transport Buffer:} Storage capacity for one month
    material in the vicinity of Sanford Lab. Handle packaging
    materials returned from underground laboratory.
  \item {\bf Re-packaging} Facilitate possible re-packaging of
    components before transport underground.
  \item {\bf Component Fabrication:} Possibly provide a capability for
    fabrication of components near Sanford Lab. Undergraduate science
    and engineering students from the South Dakota School of Mines and
    Technology (SDSM\&T) may contribute low cost effort to these
    fabrication activities.
  \item {\bf Component Integration:} Some integration activities may
    be best accomplished in proximity to Sanford Lab. A possible
    example is connecting photodetectors and cold electronics to APAs.
  \item {\bf Inspection, Testing and Repair:} Consortia will define
    their testing requirements including procedures and
    criteria. Consortia will also specify procedures in cases of test
    failure, for example, repair, return to source or discard.
  \item {\bf Visitor Support:} Consortia will likely send staff to the
    ITF for the integration, testing and installation of the consortia
    detector components. The ITF will provide temporary space,
    computer access, assistance personnel and other infrastructure
    support for DUNE visitors.
\item {\bf Outreach:} The ITF may be well located to support a public outreach program. The DUNE Experiment is likely to generate considerable public interest and addressing those interests is important to long-term public support for DUNE specifically and particle physics generally.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scope}
The scope of the ITF includes several possibly related but mostly
independent tasks. They are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\bf Cryostat:} The scope of this item is the four cryostats
  planned for installation at the 4850 level of Sanford Lab. Cryostat
  components include the warm steel structure, the stainless steel membrane and
  the insulation. The logistics for the cryostat components will be
  managed by the cryostat installation contractor and LBNF logistics
  coordinator.  Most likely this function will be met with a
  commercial warehousing vendor, who will supply suitable space,
  loading and unloading facilities and a commercial inventory
  management and control system. The vendor will provide all required
  personnel effort as part of its contracted responsibilities.
\item{\bf Cryogenics Systems:} The cryogenics systems are also an LBNF
  responsibility and cryogenics system logistics will likely be
  managed by LBNF similarly to the logistics for the cryostat
  components.
%\item{\bf Cryostat Support Structure:} This structure is an LBNF responsibility and will likely be addressed similarly to the Cryostats and the Cryogenic Systems.
\item{\bf DUNE Detectors:} The DUNE Detectors are the responsibility
  of the Collaboration as implemented by the Consortia. The role of
  the ITF will vary for the several Consortia and a description of
  these various roles is a major topic of this document.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Location }
A reasonable criterion for the location of the ITF is within about an
hour drive from Sanford Lab. That criterion yields the following
possibilities.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } \hline
{\bf Location} & {\bf 2016 Population}  \\ \hline 
Deadwood & 1,264  \\ 
Lead & 3,010  \\
Rapid City & 74,048  \\
Spearfish & 11,531  \\
Sturgis & 6,832  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Since infrastructure is correlated with population, Rapid City would seem the most likely
choice for location with Spearfish as a second possibility. In addition to overall infrastructure,
particular assets of Rapid City include proximity to SDSM\&T and a business community that is
possibly interested in incorporating a DUNE ITF into an overall regional development
program.
%Black Hills State University is located in Spearfish, but that institution is less technology oriented than SDSM\&T.

\subsubsection{\bf Requests from each consortia} 
In February of 2018, questionnaires were distributed to each consortia to seek
their requirements for ITF. Table~\ref{table:leders} lists leaders of each consortia
and names of respondents to the questionnaires, while Tab.~\ref{table:responses}
summarizes their needs for the ITF.

\end{center}
\end{table}

\noindent Responses from each consortia are followed below.

\paragraph{\bf Transport Buffer}
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\bf High Voltage System} $1000~m^2$ maximum needed ($1$ month before the start of 
TPC installation and $1$ month before the end of the TPC installation) in which
$\sim500~m^2$ for dedicated space and  $500~m^2$ for shared space. 
Humidity needs to be $<70\%$. Re-packaging area needs to be class 100,000
and no insects. There also needs to be a crane coverage between buffer and re-packaging areas.
  \item {\bf APA} For 40--80 APAs, say 
minimum of $\sim1000m^2$, including a place for a cleanroom.
This is based on $1$ year APA production 
and assume they will be transported from the manufacturing facility straight after they are made.
The space can be shared.
There need to be crane access, large door openings, height enough to lift boxes and allow fork lift.
 Some APAs will be kept in transport boxes and after the PDs and electronic boxes have been added, 
they will be ``hung'' in a clean, dry area, ready for transport to SURF in a specialized box.
  \item {\bf DAQ} Area for some boxes and crates needed, but not while shipping containers.
And it can be shared..). It should meed standard electronics environment as well.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} A total of $40~m^2$ of space
to be populated with racks and possibly one cabinet with dry air storage.
The space can be shared, although we would prefer not to have to share the dry air cabinets.
We prefer to avoid storage at temperatures below $10^\circ$C and we would also prefer an environment with a controlled humidity level such that the dew point in the storage area 
is below $5^\circ$C. 

For components that will be installed on the APAs at the integration facility,
they need to be stored (after unpacking) in a dry-air cabinets such that the dew point is 
significantly below that of the room temperature (a relative humidity in the dry air cabinets at the 
level of $30\%$ is sufficient to ensure this). We also need these cabinets to be connected to ground 
such that we can store the components minimizing the possibility of having electrostatic discharge 
damage.
  \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} The largest space will be taken by the signal chimneys (box for a chimney $2.2\times0.5\times0.5~m^3$), $240$ chimneys to be installed, $30\%$ buffer.
We would need $50~m^2$ dedicated space out of the total $200~m^2$ space.
No particular environmental requirements are needed, but we would need
handling facilities for the chimneys boxes with weight $\sim100$ kg.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} We would need a dedicated space of
$45~m^2$ with dark room with climate (temperature and humidity) control.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Re-packaging}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf High Voltage System} Nearly all CPA, FC modules are shipped in $20'$ shipping 
containers with high packing density.  These units need to be transferred to the UG crates to be 
provided by the HVS.  During this process, some basic inspection and tests will be performed either 
by HVS personnel or trained ITF staff.  An outer layer of plastic bag/sheet will be removed and 
replaced on the module before mounted into the UG crates.
  \item {\bf APA} We will be using a separate transport box to crane the APAs into the SURF facility, 
therefore will need a crane to repackage in a reasonably clean area. 
  \item {\bf DAQ} We will likely set some stuff up in conjunction with the cold electronics reception/test station.  In which case, that would need to be disassembled and shipped out afterwards.  With respect to the main volume of Production DAQ stuff, it would come in computer boxes, pallets, or possibly electronics racks.  
We are not sure if this would need repackaged to go down the shaft, however.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} This is hard to predict at this point. For 
examples for detector cables we may want to transfer the cables onto spools that can be used to 
speed up the installation of the cables in the APAs once the APAs are brought into the toaster in the 
mine. For other components (crates, power supplies) we may need to transfer the components from 
the original packing used for the shipment from the institutions where the components were 
fabricated or tested into a different packing that is optimized for the transport in the mine of the set 
of components that are going to be installed in a short time period, or that facilitate lifting the 
components on the top of the cryostat. The possibility of fully populating racks or even crates prior 
to the transport in the mine, installation on the top of the cryostat, cannot be excluded. Depending 
on the nature of the work, we expect that some monitoring or active participation in the 
re-packaging activities will be provided by members of the consortium.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} Very likely there will be no re-packaging.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} The original packaging will be opened for testing of the equipment inside. Re-packaging will be done using the original packaging materials. At this stage, additional external attachments might be added in order to make the package more suitable for underground transportation. These may include vibration dampers, locks, carriage hooks, etc.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Component Fabrication} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf High Voltage System} No need of fabrication capabilities of the ITF.
  \item {\bf APA} There is always a need for technical effort, the specifics of this is difficult to 
evaluate at this time, but may include simple tooling needs, turning, milling, drilling, grinding etc.
  \item {\bf DAQ} We might need for things we didn't anticipate beforehand --- do we need new mounting brackets, strain relief, etc.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} We do not expect to do any fabrication work at 
the ITF. We cannot however exclude the need for small repairs or the need for the quick fabrication 
of tooling that may be needed either at the ITF or at Sanford Lab. We expect to have engineer(s) and 
technician(s) from the consortium institution available for these activities, but we may need to 
resort to the help of local personnel from the SDSM\&T. For small repairs we are likely to require a 
small electronic shop.
  \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} Very likely no need.
  \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} We might choose to perform the TPB coating of the 
PMTs at ITF. In this case, a coating facility will be established in a dedicated space at ITF, 
dimensions to be determined at a later stage. The operations will be supervised by DPPD and will 
likely be executed by students/engineers. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Component Integration}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf High Voltage System} It is possible that the integration of the top field cage to the 
ground plane (attaching the ground plane tiles to the top FC modules), or the integration of the 
bottom ground plane (linking the ground plane tiles into larger modules) can be carried out at the 
ITF.
  \item {\bf APA} Skilled technical effort will be needed with APA integration assembly, tooling 
attachment, some cabling assistance. Some of this will be because of health and safety reasons. Space requirement is $100 m^2$ for $1$ to $2$ APAs
  \item {\bf DAQ} Possibly, rack stuffing.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} We expect that the installation and testing of 
the cold electronics onto the APAs that will take place at the Integration facility will be performed by 
member of the Cold Electronics Consortium stationed there. We plan to have a team comprising at 
least one engineer, one technician and several students/postdocs/scientists to perform these 
activities. Students from SDSM\&T could be integrated in this team mostly for the testing activities, 
but we do expect that the majority of the team will be composed by member of the Cold Electronics 
Consortium at all times.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} We do not plan to perform integration at the ITF.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} DPPD deliverables will not require integration with 
other subsystem elements at the ITF.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Inspection, Testing and Repair}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf High Voltage System} During the re-packaging of the CPA/FC/GP modules, perform 
visual inspection of damages, electrical continuity test of a set predetermined test points and a 
small number of resistivity measurements.  Test results will be logged in the traveler documents 
accompanying the modules.  Test instruments will be provided by HVS.  Repairs will be performed 
by HVS experts. Entire process needs to be in class $100,000$ clean space. 
  \item {\bf APA} We will need a reasonably clean area for visual inspection and possibly the tension 
of the wires.  And there will be a full test of the APA in a cold box and will require liquid nitrogen.
We might need minor repairs only.
  \item {\bf DAQ} Testing of components to make sure they arrived ok, at the level of ``does it turn on'' or ``there's no link light''.  More detailed testing could be done remotely by DAQ experts and if repairs are needed, it should be shipped back for expert TLC.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} The Cold Electronics consortium plans to use 
the Integration Facility mostly for installing the Front End Motherboards on the APAs and then 
performing tests of the fully populated APA prior to the shipment of the APA to Sanford Lab. These 
activities will be performed jointly by the APA, Photon Detector and Cold Electronics consortia, 
using equipment that will also be provided by the Cold Instrumentation and Slow Controls 
consortium and by the DAQ Consortium. The facility required for the installation and the test of the 
Front End Motherboards onto the APA should be modeled on the protoDUNE installation area. It 
requires a crane system for lifting the APA from its shipping box, a suspension system using rails 
that can be used to move the APA in and out of an area dedicated to the installation of the 
electronics and in and out of a cold box to be used for tests. Scissor lifts or a system of platforms 
should be in place to allow work at heights. The team responsible for the protoDUNE installation 
should provide feedback in the design of this area. A detailed study of the scheduling for the 
integration of the electronics and the photon detector system on the APA should be done to 
understand how many areas where this work is performed in parallel are needed (we expect that at 
least two stations operating in parallel are requires). At the moment we do not foresee the need to 
perform other tests at the integration facility. We would still prefer to keep the option open for 
having a small laboratory space ($20 m^2$) where we can test Front End Motherboards that do not 
perform as expected after the installation on the APAs to decide whether they should be repaired 
locally or sent back to one of the Consortium institutions for further investigation/repairs.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} Just integrity of the transportation packaging, 
no opening of the packaging.
   \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} We will perform basic operation and quality checks on 
the photodetectors, calibrations systems, cables, fibers and high voltage system components. 
Photodetectors will be tested for basic operation, others might be as simple as visual inspection. 
The laboratory space required for these test is minimum $40~m^2$. This laboratory space must 
have climate control, sufficient electrical and cabling infrastructure (racks, power, lighting, cable 
trays) and reasonable proximity to the DPPD storage area. The testing operations will be supervised 
by DPPD and will likely be executed by students.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\bf Visitor Support} 

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf High Voltage System} A common shared office space with other consortia member 
would suffice. We expect to have $\sim2$ long term (commute between ITF and SURF),
 up to $5$ short term visitors.
  \item {\bf APA} Likely over a period of 2 years with $4$ people full time plus $4$ people visiting 
part time $50\%$ and $4$ people underground ($1$ engineer, $2$ physicists and $1$ tech) for
 $1$ year.
  \item {\bf DAQ} During commissioning, at least the same size team as will be at Protodune. 
 During operations, probably one or two experts steady-state.
  \item {\bf Single Phase Cold Electronics} We expect that a large
    fraction of the students/postdocs/scientific personnel from the
    consortium will spend long periods of time (between $3$ months and
    $1$ year) at the integration facility and at Sanford Laboratory. A
    smaller fraction of the personnel will commute for shorter periods
    of time. We expect a similar pattern for engineers and
    technicians. Overall, we expect to have a team of 12--15 people
    from the Cold Electronics consortium will be present at all times
    at the Integration Facility. A similar number of people (up to
    $20$) working on the installation of the detector in Sanford Lab
    may also expect to be able to use any support infrastructure for
    visitors at the Integration Facility.
  \item {\bf Dual Phase Cold Electronics} $2$ visitors, stay of the order of a few months.
  \item {\bf Dual Phase Photon Detection} Eight visitors for $4$ months/year; 
four visitors for $12$ months/year.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Management:}
The management of the ITF should likely be provided by one or more
DUNE Collaborating Institutions. A possible choice is SDSM\&T because
of its physical proximity, its understanding of the local
infrastructure and relationships and its ability to provide some
specialized effort and specialized facilities that might benefit
the ITF.  Some preliminary discussions with SDSM\&T management
have already occurred. These discussions should be ongoing as the
parameters for the ITF become more definite.


\subsubsection{Inventory System:}
Effective inventory management will be essential for all aspects of
DUNE detector development, construction, installation and operation.
While its relevance and importance go beyond the Integration and Test
Facility, the ITF is the location at which LBNF, DUNE project
management, consortia scientific personnel and SURF operations will
interface.  We therefore will develop standards and protocols for
inventory management as part of the ITF planning.  A critical
requirement for the project is that the inventory management system
for procurement, construction and installation must be compatible with
future QA, calibration and detector performance database systems.
Experience with past large detector projects, notably NOvA, has
demonstrated that the capability to track component-specific
information is extremely valuable throughout installation, testing,
commissioning and routine operation.  Compatibility between separate
inventory management and physics information systems will be
maintained for effective operation and analysis of DUNE.

DUNE will rely on a commercial vendor for warehouse and logistics
services in Rapid City or another location nearby to SURF.  Warehouse
vendors have a variety of inventory software packages and standards,
and final specification of the DUNE/LBNF system cannot happen until
the project warehouse vendor is selected.  Discussions are being
coordinated closely with LBNF and initial visits and meetings with
warehouse vendors and software suppliers have occurred.  DUNE
scientific personnel will continue to evaluate candidate systems and
assure interoperability with a future physics database
information systems.

Because of the widely distributed nature of the DUNE development and
construction project and the required compatibility with a commercial
warehouse management system, we plan to develop core inventory
management capabilities based on a service-oriented architecture.  URL
connections will be used to pass data (JSON format) to RESTful APIs,
which have task-specific code written in Python that communicates with
standard PostgresSQL database that will be developed for DUNE by
Fermilab.  Specialized code at remote sites would also be in Python.

Implementation within a commercial cloud-based computing environment,
well suited to the international DUNE project, is also under
consideration.  A recent visit to Rapid City revealed that Dakota
Warehouse
(\href{https://dakotawarehouse.com}{https://dakotawarehouse.com}), a
leading candidate for providing LBNF/DUNE warehouse services for
detector components, including cryostat and cryogenic systems, uses a
cloud-based commercial software package, 3PL Central
(\href{https://3plcentral.com}{https://3plcentral.com}), in which
orders of shipments and stock status are entered and queried through
an internet browser interface.  We will consider the feasibility of
this or a similar platform for LBNF and DUNE.
