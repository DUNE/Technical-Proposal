\section{Integration Engineering}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-sysengr}
%				7 pages

The major aspects of detector integration focus on the mechanical and
electrical connections between each of the detector systems. This
includes verification that subassemblies and their interfaces are
correct (e.g. APA and SPPD). A second major area is in the support of
the detector and its interfaces to the cryostat and cryogenics. A
third major area is in assuring that the detector can be installed ---
that the integrated components can be moved into their final
configuration. A fourth major area is in the integration of the
detector with the necessary services provided by the conventional
facilities.

\subsection{Configuration Management}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-config}

The \dword{dune} Technical Coordination engineering team will maintain
configuration data in the appropriate format for the management of the
detector configuration. The consortia are responsible for providing
engineering data for their subsystems to technical coordination. The
TC engineering team will work with the \dword{lbnf} project team to
integrate the full detector data into the global \dword{lbnf}
configuration files. Appropriate thresholds for tracking and for
change control will be established.

For mechanical design aspects, the \dword{dune} TC engineering team
will maintain full 3-D CAD models of the detectors. Appropriate level
of detail will be specified for each type of model. Each consortium
will be responsible for providing CAD models of their detector
components to be integrated into overall models. The TC engineering
team will work with the \dword{lbnf} project team to integrate the
full detector models into a global \dword{lbnf} CAD model which will
include cryostats, cryogenic systems, and the conventional
facilities. These will include models using varying software
packages. The TC engineering team will work directly with the
consortia Technical Leads and their supporting engineering teams to
resolve any detector component interference or interface issues with
other detector systems, detector infrastructure, and facility
infrastructure.

For electrical design aspects, the TC engineering team will maintain
high level interface documents which describe all aspects of required
electrical infrastructure and electrical connections. All consortia
must document power requirements and rack space
requirements. Consortia are responsible for defining any cabling which
bridges the design efforts of two or more consortia. This agreed upon
and signed-off interface documentation shall include cable
specification, connector specification, connector pinout and any data
format, signal levels and timing. All cables, connectors, printed
circuit board components, physical layout and construction will be
subject to project review. This is especially true of elements which
will be inaccessible during the project lifetime. Consortia shall
provide details on liquid argon temperature acceptance testing and
lifetime of components, boards, cables and connectors.


At the time of the release of the Technical Design Reports, the
project engineering team will work with the consortia to produce
formal engineering drawings for all detector components.  These
drawings are expected to be signed by the consortia Technical Leads,
project engineers, and Technical Coordinator.  Starting from that
point, the detector models and drawings will sit under formal change
control as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-qa}.  It is
anticipated that designs will undergo further revisions prior to the
start of detector construction, but any changes made after the release
of the Technical Design Reports will need to be agreed to by all of
the drawing signers and an updated, signed drawing produced. The major
areas of configuration management include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 3-D Model
  \item Interface Definitions
  \item Envelope Drawings for installation
  \item Drawing management
\end{enumerate}

Technical Coordination will put into place processes for configuration
management.  Configuration management will provide technical
coordination and engineering staff the ability to define and control
the actual build of the detector at any point in time and to track any
changes which may occur over duration of the build as well as the
lifetime of the project as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-qa}.

For detector elements within the cryostat, configuration management
will be frozen once the elements are permanently sealed within the
cryostat.  However, during the integration and installation process of
building the detector within the cryostat, changes may need to occur.
For detector elements outside the cryostat and accessible, all
repairs, replacements, hardware upgrades, system grounding changes,
firmware and software changes must be tracked.

Any change will require revision control, configuration
identification, change management and release management.

{\bf Revision Control}\\ Consortia will be responsible for providing
accurate and well documented revision control.  Revision control
should provide a method of tracking and maintaining the history of
changes to a detector element.  Each detector element must be clearly
identified with a document which includes a revision number and
revision history.  For mechanical elements, this will be reflected by
a drawing number with revision information.  For electrical elements,
schematics will be used to track revisions.  Consortia will be
responsible for identifying the revision status of each installed
detector elements. Revisions are further controlled through maintenance
of the documents in DocDB and \dword{edms}.

{\bf Configuration Identification}\\
Consortia are responsible for providing unique identifiers or part
numbers for each detector element.  Plans will be developed on how
inventories will be maintained and tracked during the build.  Plans
will clearly identify any dynamic configuration modes which may be
unique to a specific detector element.  For example, a printed circuit
board may have firmware which effects its performance.

{\bf Change Management}\\
Technical Coordination will provide guidelines
for formal change management.  During the beginning phase of the
project, drawings and interface documents are expected to be signed by
the consortia Technical Leads, project engineers, and Technical
Coordinator.  Once this initial design phase is complete, the detector
models, drawings, schematics and interface documents will be under
formal change control.  It is anticipated that designs will undergo
further revisions prior to the start of detector construction, but any
changes made after the release of the Technical Design Reports will
need to be agreed to by all drawing signers and an updated signed
drawing produced.

{\bf Release Management}\\
Release management focuses on the delivery of the more dynamic aspects
of the project such as firmware and software.  Consortia with
deliverables that have the ability to effect performance of the
detector by changing firmware or software must provide plans on how
these revisions will be tracked, tested and released.  The
modification of any software or firmware after the initial release,
must be formally controlled, agreed upon and tracked.

\subsection{Engineering process and support}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-integ-engr-proc}
 

The \dword{dune} Technical Coordination organization will work with
the consortia through its TC engineering team to ensure the proper
integration of all detector components.  The TC engineering team will
document requirements on engineering standards and documentation that
the consortia will need to adhere to in the design process for the
detector components under their responsibility.  Similarly, the
project QA and ES\&H managers will document quality control and safety
criteria that the consortia will be required to follow during the
construction, installation, and commissioning of their detector
components, as discussed in sections~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-qa}
and~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-esh}.


Consortia interfaces with the conventional facilities, cryostats, and
cryogenics are managed through the \dword{dune} Technical Coordination
organization.  The TC engineering team will work with the
consortia to understand their interfaces to the facilities and then
communicate these globally to the \dword{lbnf} project team.  For conventional
facilities the types of interfaces to be considered are requirements
for bringing needed detector components down the shaft and through the
underground tunnels to the detector cavern, overall requirements for
power and cooling in the detector caverns, and the requirements on
cable connections from the underground area to the surface.
Interfaces to the cryostat include the number and sizes of the
penetrations on top of the cryostat, required mechanical structures
attaching to the cryostat walls for supporting cables and
instrumentation, and requirements on the global positioning of the
detector within the cryostat.  Cryogenic system interfaces include
requirements on the location of inlet/output ports, requirements on
the monitoring of the liquid argon both inside and outside the
cryostat, and grounding/shielding requirements on piping attached to
the cryostat.

\dword{lbnf} will be responsible for the design and construction of the
cryostats used to house the detectors.  The consortia are required to
provide input on the location and sizes of the needed penetrations at
the top of the cryostats.  The consortia also need to specify any
mechanical structures to be attached to the cryostat walls for
supporting cables or instrumentation.  The \dword{dune} project engineering
team will work with the \dword{lbnf} cryostat engineering team to understand
what attached fixturing is possible and iterate with the consortia as
necessary.  The consortia will also work with the project engineering
team through the development of the 3-D CAD model to understand the
overall position of the detector within the cryostat and any issues
associated with the resulting locations of their detector components.

\dword{lbnf} will be responsible for the cryogenics systems used to purge,
cool, and fill the cryostats.  It will also be responsible for the
system that continually re-circulates liquid argon through filtering
systems to remove impurities.  Any detector requirements on the flow
of liquid within the cryostat should be developed by the consortia and
transmitted to \dword{lbnf} through the project engineering team.  Similarly,
any requirements on the rate of cool-down or maximum temperature
differential across the cryostat during the cool-down process should
be specified by the consortia and transmitted to the \dword{lbnf} team.

The engineering design process is defined by a set of steps taken to
fulfill the requirements of the design.  By the time of the Technical
Design Report, all design requirements must be fully defined and
proposed designs must be shown meet these requirements.  Based on
prior work, some detector elements may be quite advanced in the
engineering process, while others may be in earlier stages.  Each
design process shall closely follow the engineering steps described
below.


{\bf Development of specifications}\\ Each consortium is responsible
for the technical review and approval of the engineering
specifications.  The documented specifications for all major design
elements should include the scope of work, project milestones,
relevant codes and standards to be followed, acceptance criteria and
specify appropriate internal or external design reviews.
Specifications shall be treated as controlled documents and cannot be
altered without approval of the \dword{dune} Technical Coordination
team.  The TC engineering team will participate in and help facilitate
all major reviews as described in
Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-reviews}.  Special Technical Board reviews
will be scheduled for major detector elements.

{\bf Engineering Risk Analysis}\\ Each consortium is responsible for
identifying and defining the level of risk associated with their
deliverables as described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-risk}.
\dword{dune} Technical Coordination will work with the consortia,
through its TC engineering team, to document these risks in a Risk
Database and follow them throughout the project until they are
realized or can be retired.

{\bf Specification Review}\\
The \dword{dune} Technical Coordination organization and project engineers
shall review consortia specifications for overall compliance with the
project requirements.  Consortia must document all internal reviews
and provide that documentation to the Technical Coordination staff.
Additional higher level reviews may be scheduled by the Technical
Coordination staff as described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-reviews}.

{\bf System Design}\\
The system design process includes the production of mechanical
drawings, electrical schematics, calculations which verify compliance
to engineering standards, firmware, printed circuit board layout,
cabling and connector specification, software plans, and any other
aspects that lead to a fully documented functional design.  All
relevant documentation shall be recorded, with appropriate document
number, into the chosen engineering data management system and be
available for the review process.

{\bf Design Review}\\ The design review process is determined by the
complexity and risk associated with the design element.  For a simple
design element, the consortia may do an internal review.  For a more
complex or high risk element a formal review will be scheduled.  The
\dword{dune} Technical Coordination staff will facilitate the review,
bringing in outside experts as needed.  In all cases, the result of
any reviews should be well documented and captured in the engineering
data management system.  If recommendations are made, those
recommendations will be tracked in a database and the consortia will
be expected to provide responses. All results of these engineering
reviews will be made available for the subsystem design reviews
described in Section~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-reviews}.

{\bf Procurement}\\ The procurement process will include the
documented technical specifications for all procured materials and
parts.  All procurement technical documents are reviewed for
compliance to engineering standards, safety and environmental
concerns.  The \dword{dune} Technical Coordination staff will assist the
consortia in working with their procurement staff as needed.

{\bf Production and assembly}\\ During the implementation phase of the project,
the consortia shall provide the Technical Coordinator with updates on
schedule.  A test plan will be fully developed which will allow for
verification that the initial requirements have been met. This is part of
the quality assurance plan that will be documented and followed as described
in Section ~\ref{sec:fdsp-coord-qa}.

{\bf Testing and Validation\\} The testing plan documented in the
above step will be followed and results will be well documented in
consultation with the QAM.  The Technical Coordinator and engineering
team will be informed as to the results and whether the design meets
the specifications.  If not, a plan will be formulated to address any
shortcomings and presented to the Technical Coordinator.

{\bf Final Documentation\\} Final reports should be generated which
describe the as built equipment, lessons learned, safety reports,
installation procedures, testing results and operations procedures.
