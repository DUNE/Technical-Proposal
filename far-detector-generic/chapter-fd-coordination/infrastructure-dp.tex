\section{Detector Infrastructure}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-infrastructure}

TC is responsible for delivering the common infrastructure for the
detector. This infrastructure is typically equipment that is used by
many groups. This may include: the electronics racks on top of the
cryostat with power and cooling, cable trays, cryostat crossing
tubes and flanges and ground monitoring and isolation transformers.

TC is responsible for the systems to support the detectors. For the
dual-phase detector this may consist of a cable winch system similar
to ProtoDUNE-DP.  In the case of the single-phase detector the
installation group will also provide the \dword{dss} which supports
the detector and is needed to bring equipment into the correct
location in the cryostat.
