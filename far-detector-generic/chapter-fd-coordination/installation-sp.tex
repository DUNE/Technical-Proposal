%\subsection{Organization}
%\label{sec:fdsp-coord-org}

Installation Coordination and Support (or simply Installation) is
responsible for coordinating the detector installations, providing
detector installation support and providing installation related
infrastructure. The installation group management responsibility is
shared by a scientific lead and a technical lead. The installation
group reports directly to the Technical Coordinator. The underground
group will be referred to as the \dword{uit}. The \dword{itf} group which delivers equipment to the Ross
Shaft and the \dword{uit} which receives the equipment underground need to be
in close communication and work closely together.

Underground installation is in general responsible for coordinating
and supporting the installation of the detectors and providing
necessary infrastructure for installation of the experiment. While the individual
consortia are responsible for the installation of their own detector
equipment it is essential that the detector installation be planned
as a whole and that a single group coordinates the installation and
adapts the plans throughout the installation process. The \dword{uit} has 
responsibility for overall coordination of the installations. In
conjunction with each consortium the \dword{uit} will make the installation
plan that describes how the detectors are to be installed. The
installation plan is used to define the spaces and infrastructure that
will be needed to install the detectors. The installation plan will
also be used to define the interfaces between the Installation group
and the consortia deliverables.  The installation scope includes the
infrastructure needed to install the detector such as the cleanroom, a
small machine shop, special cranes, scissor lifts, and access equipment.
Additional equipment required for installation includes: rigging equipment, hand tools, diagnostic equipment
(including oscilloscopes, network analyzers and leak detector), local storage with some critical supplies and some PPE. The \dword{uit} will also provide trained personnel to operate the installation
infrastructure. The consortia will provide the detector elements and
custom tooling and fixtures as required to install their detector
components.
%In the case of the single-phase detector the installation
%group will also provide the detector support system (DSS) which
%supports the detector and is needed to bring equipment into the
%cryostat.

%In addition to the installation specific infrastructure the
%installation group will also be responsible for general detector
%infrastructure like electronics racks, cable trays, power, and if
%needed additional optical fibers in the shafts.

 

%The \dword{dune} production phases are divided into
%production setup and production. Scope that represents a one time
%investment is included in production setup while equipment and
%infrastructure that scales with the number of detectors is included in
%production. With this definition several of the possible work packages
%are empty. For example once the surface logistics facility is setup it
%will be used for all \num{4} detectors so its scope is completely under
%production setup.



%The organization of the full installation scope into
%work packages that are associated with the different phase of the
%project and the lower level WBS divisions are shown in
%Figure~\ref{WP_def}.

\subsection{Underground Detector Installation}
\label{sec:fdsp-coord-undergd}

For the \dword{dune} detectors to be installed in safe and efficient
manner the effort of the individual consortia need to be coordinated
such that the installation is planned as a coherent process. The
interfaces between the individual components needs to be understood
and the spaces required for the installation process planned and
documented. The installation planning needs to take into account the
plans and scope of the \dword{lbnf} effort and the individual plans of
the nine consortia. By working with the \dword{lbnf} team and the
members of the consortia responsible for building and installing their
components, a joint installation plan and schedule taking into account
the all the activities and needs of all the stakeholders can be
developed. Though the organization of the installation effort is still
evolving the equivalent of the scientific lead is the installation
coordinator.

One of the primary early responsibilities of the \dword{uit} is to
develop and maintain the \dword{dune} installation plan and the
installation schedule. The \dword{dune} installation plan will
describe the installation process in sufficient detail to demonstrate
how all the individual consortium installation plans mesh and it will
give the overview of the installation process. The installation plan
is used by the \dword{uit} to define the underground infrastructure
needed for the detector installation and the interfaces to the
consortia. The \dword{uit} will be responsible for reviewing and
approving the consortia installation plans. Approved installation
plans, engineering design notes, signed final drawings, Safety
documentation and procedures are all prerequisites for the Production
Readiness Reviews (PRR). Approved procedures, safety approval, and
proper training are all required before the \dword{uit} will perform
work. During the installation phase the installation leadership will
coordinate the \dword{dune} installation effort and adapt the schedule
as needed. The installation coordinator with management will also
resolve issues when problems occur.

The installation infrastructure to be provided by the \dword{uit} includes:
the underground ISO 8 (or class \num{100000}) clean room used for the
installation, cranes and hoists (if they are not delivered by
\dword{lbnf}), scissor lifts, areal lifts, and the common work
platforms outside the cryostat. The \dword{uit} will have responsibility for
operating this equipment and assisting the consortia with activities
related to rigging, material transport, and logistics. Each consortium
is responsible for the installation of their own equipment so the
responsibility of the installation group is limited, but the material
handling scope is substantial. To support the installation process an
installation foreman will lead a trained crew with the main
responsibility of transporting the equipment to the necessary location
and operating the cranes, hoists, and other common equipment needed
for the installation. It is expected that the installation crew will
work with the teams from the various consortia but will mainly act in
a supporting function. The \dword{uit} foreman will be responsible for
supervising the \dword{uit} crew, but the ultimate responsibility for all
detector components will remain with the consortia even while the
underground team is rigging or transporting these components.  This
will be critical in case parts are damaged during transport or
installation, as the consortia need to judge the necessary
actions. For this reason, a representative or point-of-contact (POC)
from the consortia must be present when any work is performed on their
equipment. The consortium is responsible for certifying that each
installation step is properly performed.

The \dword{uit} acts as the primary point of contact with \dword{lbnf}/SURF
from the time the components reach the Ross headframe until the
equipment reaches the experimental cavern (if something goes wrong
SURF calls the \dword{uit} leader who then contacts the responsible
party). The consortia are responsible for delivering to the \dword{uit} all
approved procedures and specialized tooling required for
transport. The \dword{uit} leader acts as a point of contact if the
\dword{lbnf}/SURF team has questions or difficulties with the
underground transport.  The \dword{uit} receives the materials from
\dword{lbnf}/SURF at the entrance to the \dword{dune} excavations. The
\dword{uit} then delivers the equipment to the required underground location.

In an effort to get an early estimate of the equipment required to
install the detectors the \dword{uit} has developed a preliminary installation
plan which outlines the installation process. At present the
installation plan consists of a 3-D model of the cryostat in the
excavations. The \dword{sp} detector elements are inserted in the
model and a proposal for how they are transported, assembled, and
inserted into the cryostat has been developed as a series of images in
powerpoint. Conceptual designs of the infrastructure needed to support
the transport and assembly are also included in the model. With this
as a tool the proposed installation sequence can be iterated with the
consortia to converge on a baseline installation plan. A similar
process will be followed for the \dword{dp} detector once the base
configuration for the \dword{sp} installation is agreed upon. The \dword{uit}
has focused initially on the \dword{sp} detector as the \dword{sp}
components are larger and the installation process more
complex. Images showing the \dword{sp} installation sequence are shown
in Fig.~\ref{Install-Seq}.

The current installation plan is described. \dword{dune} will take
ownership of the different underground areas at different times. The
surface data room and the underground room in the CUC are available
significantly before the collaboration has access to the cryostats and
the optical fibers between the surface and underground will be in
place even earlier. This will allow a DAQ prototype to be developed
and tested early. The installation of the DAQ hardware can also be
finished before the start of detector installation if desired so the
DAQ will not be on critical path.  When the collaboration receives
access to Cryostat~\#1 the steel work for Cryostat~\#2 will be
finished and the work on installing the membrane will have
started. Excavation will be complete.  For planning purposes it is assumed that the first detector will be single-phase and the second dual-phase. The first step in the \dword{sp} 
installation is to install the cryo-piping and the \dword{dss}. As the
cryo-piping will require welding and grinding it is a dirty process
and must be complete before the area can be used as a cleanroom. When
this is complete the cryostat can be cleaned and the false floor
re-installed. The clean infrastructure needed to install the detector
including the cleanroom, work platforms, scaffolding, and the
fixturing to hold the detector elements during assembly and all the
lifts need to be set up. Once the infrastructure is in place and the area
clean the installation of the main elements can start. The general
layout of the installation area showing the necessary space and
equipment is shown in the top panels in Figure~\ref{Install-Seq}.

The \dword{sp} detector is installed by first installing the west endwall or
endwall~\#1 (see Fig.~\ref{fig:endwall}).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{endwall.png}
\caption{End view of single phase detector with endwall field cage in
  place, along with one row of \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa}.}
\label{fig:endwall}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
The \dwords{apa} and \dwords{cpa} with top/bottom FC panels are
installed next. The plan is to install \num{6} \dwords{apa} and \num{4}
\dwords{cpa} per week which is enough to complete one of the \num{25}
rows every week. Additional time is built into the schedule to take
into account that the installation will be slower at the beginning and
some re-work may be needed. By building west-to-east complete rows can
be finished and tested before moving to the next row. This reduces the
risk that after final FC deployment and cabling that a fault is found
which would require dismantling part of the detector. Some of the steps
needed to install the \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} modules outside the
cryostat are also shown in Figure~\ref{Install-Seq}.  The middle three
panels show how the \dword{apa} needs to be handled in order to rotate
it and mount it to the assembly frame. After two \dword{apa} are
mounted on top of each other the cabling for the lower \dwords{apa}
cold electronics and photon detector cables can be installed. The
lower three panels show how the \SI{2}{m} \dword{cpa} sub-panels are
removed form the transport crates and assembled on holding frame. Once
the \dword{cpa} module is assembled the Field Cage units can them be
mounted. Finally once the \dword{apa} and \dword{cpa} are installed
the endWall~\#2 can be installed. A high level summary of the schedule
is shown in Figure~\ref{Install-Schedule}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\end{figure}



As is seen in the installation schedule the second cryostat becomes
available four months before the first detector installation is
complete. In this period installation work for both detectors will
proceed in parallel. Like the \dword{sp} detector the first step is
the installation of the cryo-piping followed by a thorough cleaning
and installation of the false floor. While the cryo-piping is being
installed the \dword{dp} chimneys for the electronics along with the
DPPD and CRP instrumentation feedthrus can also be installed. The
chimneys are installed into the roof of the cryostat so this work is
performed well away from the final installation work on the first
detector so there should be no conflicts. Once the first detector is
installed work on setting up the second detector installation
infrastructure can begin. This work includes moving the cranes and
work platforms along with moving the walls of the cleanroom so the
second cryostat is clean. The air filtration to the cryostat will also
be moved to the second cryostat.  Much of the work for the \dword{dp}
installation will be performed inside the cryostat so in principal a
smaller cleanroom area outside the cryostat is needed. However for
planning purposes it will not be completely sure what type detector
will be installed in the second cryostat until fairly late so the \dword{uit}
will plan to provide a sufficiently large area outside the cryostat to
accommodate either detector technology.  The\dword{dp} detector itself
would require a much smaller cleanroom which could be installed just
outside the TCO. The installation process inside the detector will
proceed East to West. At the start of the TPC installation the first
\num{4} CRP will be installed which comprises the first row of
CRP. The left panel in Figure~\ref{fig:CRP-Install} shows two CRPs
being installed near the roof of the cryostat and the right panel
shows one of the CRP in a transport box being moved into the cryostat.
Once the first CRP row is installed and tested then the first field
cage endwall can be installed. In general rows of CRP will be
installed and then behind them rows of field cage modules are
installed followed by the cathode installation at the bottom of the
detector and the photon detector PMTs under the cathode plane. Finally
at the end of the installation the second field cage endwall is
installed and a final testing period for the full detector is
foreseen. The \dword{dp} installation sequence is shown in green in
Figure~\ref{Install-Schedule}.

  detector. The DP field cage modules will be inserted in a similar
  fashion.}

Prior to the TDR mutually agreed upon installation plans will need to
be approved. These will set the schedule for the installation and will
determine the planning for staffing and budget. Having good estimates
for the time needed and having enough experience to ensure the
interfaces are understood and the procedures are complete is important
for accurate planning. The experience at \dword{protodune} will be
very important as the \dword{protodune} installation establishes the
procedures for handling all the detector elements and in many cases
gives accurate estimates for the time needed. However in the case of
the single-phase detector many of these procedures need to revised or
newly developed as the \dword{dune} detector will be twice as high as
\dword{protodune} so two \dwords{apa} need to be assembled together
and then a totally different cabling scheme is needed. Testing the
cabling will need to be complete prior to the TDR as this is needed to
ensure the design is viable. The dual-phase will also need to develop
new installation procedures as the \dword{dune} \dword{dp} detector
will have a significantly different field cage and cathode plane. 

The installation by definition is on the critical path making it vital
that the work be performed efficiently and in a manner that has low
risk. In order to achieve this a prototype of the installation
equipment for the \dword{dune} \dword{sp} will be constructed at Ash
River and the installation process tested with dummy detector
elements. It is expected that the setup will be available at the time
of the TDR, but any lessons learned will need to be implemented and
tested after this. In the period just prior to the start of
installation the Ash River setup will be used as a training ground for
the \dword{uit}.

%The \dword{uit} is responsible for delivering the common infrastructure
%the detector will need to operate. This infrastructure is typically
%equipment that is used by many groups. This may include: the
%electronics racks with power and cooling, cable trays, the cryostat
%crossing tubes and flanges, rigging equipment, some tools, the ground
%monitoring and isolation transformers, necessary diagnostics equipment
%(including oscilloscopes, a network analyzers and leak detector), a
%small machine shop, storage with some critical supplies, and some PPE.

\subsection{Preparation for Operations}

After the detectors are installed in the cryostat there remains a lot
of work before the detectors can be operated. First the TCO must be
closed. This requires bringing back the cryostat manufacturer to close
the opening which was left in the cryostat originally for the detector
installation. First the missing panel with the steel beams and steel
panel are installed to complete the cryostat's outer structural
hull. Then the remaining foam blocks and membrane panels are installed
from the inside using the manholes for access. In parallel to this the
liquid argon pumps are installed at the ends of the cryostat and final
connections are made to the recirculation plant. Once the pumps are
installed, the cryostat is closed and everything is leak tested the
cryogenic plant can be brought into operation. First the air inside
the cryostat is purged by injecting pure argon gas at the bottom of
the detector at a rate such that the detector is filled uniformly but
faster than the diffusion rate. This produces a column of argon that
rises through the detector and sweeps out the air. This process is
referred to as the piston purge. When the piston purge is complete the
cooldown of the detector can begin. Misting nozzles inject a
liquid-gas mix into the cryostat which cools the detector at a
controlled rate. Once the detector is cold the filling process can
begin. Gaseous argon is brought from the surface down the shaft and is
re-condensed underground. The liquid argon then flows through filters
to remove any H$_2$O or O$_2$ and flows into the cryostat. Given the
very large volume of the cryostats and the limited cooling power for
re-condensing the liquid it is expected to take 12 months to fill the
first detector and 14 months to fill the second. During this time the
detector readout electronics will be on so the status of the detector
can be monitored. Once the detector is full the drift high voltage can
be carefully ramped up and data taking can begin.
