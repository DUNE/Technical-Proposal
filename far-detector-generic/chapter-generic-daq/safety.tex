\section{Safety}
\label{sec:fd-daq-safety}

Two overall safety plans will be followed by the FD-\dword{daq}. General work underground will comply with all safety procedures in place for working in the detector caverns and CUC underground at SURF. \dword{daq}-specific procedures for working with racks full of electronics and/or computers, as defined at FNAL, will be followed, especially with respect to electrical safety and the fire suppression system chosen for the counting room. For example, a glass wall in between the server room space and the other areas in Figure~\ref{fig:daq-install-controlroom} will be necessary to prevent workers in the server room from being unseen if they are in distress, and an adequate hearing protection regime must be put in place.

There are no other special safety items for the \dword{daq} system that are not already covered by the more general safety plans referenced above. The long-term emphasis will be on remote operations capability from around the world, limiting the need for physical presence at SURF, and with underground access required only for urgent interventions or hardware replacement.
