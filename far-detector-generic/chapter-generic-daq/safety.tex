Two overall safety plans will be followed by the FD-DAQ.  Work
underground will comply with the safety procedures in place for working
in the detector caverns and CUC underground at SURF.  In particular,
procedures for working with racks full of electronics and/or computers
as done at Fermilab will be followed,\footnote{which we should cite
  somehow}  especially with respect to the fire suppression system
chosen for the DAQ server room.  For example, a glass wall in between
the server room space and the other areas in
Fig.~\ref{fig:daq-install-controlroom} will be necessary to prevent
workers in the server room from being unseen if they are in distress.

There are not any special safety items for the DAQ system that are not
already covered by the more general safety plans referenced above.
